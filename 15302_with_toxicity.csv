Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?"" ""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts, ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"" Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky. ""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says. ""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts. ""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."" Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else. ""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies. ""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome. Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated. The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7."" - EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up!

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate. However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate. On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Rabbi pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy! Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!' Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.

119,42045,"4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it.","There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted. About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off. The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak. The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"". ""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist. ""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now."" The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life."" The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?"" The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free."" The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?"" The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide."" ""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom. Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance."" The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles. It's unbelievable. The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth. The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died."" The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""",0.0006756474,0.0063697034

He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign. But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet. Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins. Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet. But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed. Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me."" Curious, Attila did as he asked. Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila. ""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed. Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.

Completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""Welp, I've been wrong all my life and I guess I'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith"" Satan laughs and replies: ""Awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself"" He then proceeds to escort Jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live. As they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize Satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two. Every time they stop to a house Satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person. At sunset the devil sees that Jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into. As they walk to Jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and Jack asks: ""What's behind there?"" Satan: ""Oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind"" Despite his curiosity Jack thought better not to bother Satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where Satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day. That night however Jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day. After a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that Satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was. Once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall. Jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be. On the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help. Jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the Devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair. The following morning Satan showed up once again and told Jack to come with him. Jack pleaded: ""PLEASE! PLEASE! Don't take me to hell, I'll do anything just let me stay here, I don't wanna burn for all eternity!"" Satan: ""What are you talking about??? I'm just gonna show you the recreational center like I told you yesterday"" Jack: ""Don't lie to me, I saw what was going on behind the giant wall!"" Satan: ""Ooooh you saw that! Don't worry that's not for you, that's the Christian hell"" Jack: ""The christian hell? Why would the christian hell be like that?""

You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?"" To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check. ""There's no charge,"" he says.

265,33968,Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there.,"He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is. ""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here."" All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines. The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there."" So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street. ""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch. While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!"" Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel. And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!"" The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring. Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same. The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own. Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused. ""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend. The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline."" ",0.0012592450,0.0502136238

Two months ago, my husband, Tom, had a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him."" (You could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagine the pain that poor Tom must have experienced.) ""Tom was unable to hold me or the children,"" she went on, ""and every move caused him terrible pain."" We prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of Tom's scrotum, and wrap wire around it to hold it in place."" (Again, the men in the congregation cringed and squirm uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on Tom.) ""Now,"" she announced in a quivering voice, ""thank the Lord, Tom is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely."" (All the men sighed with unified relief.) The pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say. A man slowly stood up and walked just as slowly to the podium. He said, ""I'm Tom Smith."" The entire congregation held its breath. ""I just want to tell my wife -- the word is sternum.""",0.9922154546,0.0004628678
309,32588,"In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket..."," As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step. About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, ""How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!""

The policeman says, ""Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile."" Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"" The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!"" The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""

He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer."" The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""the suspect wears contact lenses.""

314,32474,A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides,"A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army. The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom. And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides. ",0.0000413211,0.0001216340

You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though. One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled. -Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve. -My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution. -My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person. -I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation. The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him. -Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life? -Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables. -You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job? -Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place. -This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours? -W-well, I don't know what to tell you.

So the next day, the farmer goes to the pet store. He looks around at the various herding dogs- they seem very fit, but young and untrained. The shopkeeper asks the farmer if he wants any help. ""Why yes,"" says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many."" The shopkeeper says, ""I've got just the thing for you."" and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting. ""Are you sure?"" asks the farmer, ""I have very many sheep and I don't think one dog will be able to round all of them up."". ""I'm sure."" says the shopkeeper, ""This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen."" ""Yes,"" says the dog, ""I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering."" The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home. That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas. ""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The soldier had been granted rest and relaxation and was on a train that was bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train in hopes of finding an empty seat. The only empty seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged English lady and was being used by her little dog. The weary soldier asked, ""Please ma'am, may I sit in that seat?"" The English woman looked down her nose at the solider and sniffed then said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see that my little pooch is using that seat?"" The soldier walked away, looking if there were any other unoccupied seats to use, but after another trip down to the end of the train, he found himself facing the woman with the dog again. Again, the soldier asked, ""Please lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired."" The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted out loud, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also extremely arrogant!"" The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog and tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

Intrigued, Bobby dropped his pants and did his business in the exact same spot in hopes of seeing how many flies he could gather. After a couple weeks of doing this, Bobby had created a rather tall pile of dung. So tall, in fact, that he now needed to use a step ladder to make sure he had a stable poo-pole developing. A curious neighbor caught sight of Bobby doing this, and after confronting Bobby, the neighbor punched Bobby in the face and told him to grow the hell up.

491,27831,A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered.,"Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He was asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer.

When he gets to the afterlife, he finds himself at the back of a miles-long line to get into Heaven. Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder... ""Want to make a bet while we wait?"" The Gambler asks. ""If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you."" The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins ""reading"" him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks. ""Don't be silly, it's just indigestion."" the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line. Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts. ""This one's easy!"" the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. ""Hold my beer!"" Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line. Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made. ""Okay, let's see..."" The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes. The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. ""You ain't taking me alive!"" The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with. The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, ""Fuck the police!"" Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before. Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. ""I'VE GOT NOTHING!"" He shouts. ""I GIVE UP!"" The man steps aside.",0.0103404419,0.9231320620

Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet.. ""How can you be so sure?"" she protested.. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something."" The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.. The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!"" The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.""",0.9866310954,0.0002246227

One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor. The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",0.0002557249,0.0001602604

The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard.

John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics.

He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society. ""Amazing! You are skilled!"" says the politician. The spy smirks. ""But I still think you American spy."" The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed. He replies, ""I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!"" The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest. The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka. After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.

The younger alien became angry at the lack of response. The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you.' The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response. Pissed at the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, ""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!"" The older alien again warned his comrade saying, 'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad.' 'Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch. Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head. 'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?' The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his pen!s over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

The horse dreams of meeting that shrimp of a jockey who whipped him all those years. What a jerk. Just one swift kick to the face and that damn jockey would never again need to worry about flossing. One mid-November day he arrives in the morning and can barely believe his luck: his former jockey has taken a job there! That dirty shrimp head won't clear the counter once I'm done stomping, thought the horse, his heart rate quickening with anticipation. The horse rushes toward the man. The jockey looks up. The horse startles. He stops in his tracks and stares. His old jockey is older, shorter, feebler than he remembered. He limps and is wearing hearing aids. Bifocals adorn the tip of his nose. And is that a colostomy bag? The horse sighs bitterly. He cannot attack an old, infirm man. The bastard has even robbed him of his revenge. He slumps at the counter, defeated. He just sits there brooding for hours. Finally the horse stirs and asks meekly for some water, but the old man snorts and says he ain't serving no horse.

Some clocks are moving rather slowly, while others go a full circle in less than ten seconds. The man asks one of the angels there about the strange wall.

Right next to Russia is tiny Estonia, and next to that Finland, Sweden and Norway, all going steadily forward, almost simultaneously. But one clock is missing.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?"" ""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts, ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"" Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky. ""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says. ""President Trump,"" his boss quickly retorts. ""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. At the White House, Trump spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."" Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else. ""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies. ""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome. Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican. Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics. Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?"" His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out onto the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",0.0000801164,0.0122428723

Sam tries again, ""Bangidy, bang, bang, bang!"" Nothing. As the enemy soldier gets closer, Sam cries out, ""Stabidy, stab, stab, stab."" But the enemy soldier runs right over him, crushing him.

I know this may be a little forward but I would love to grab coffee with you some time."" Flattered, the man responds, ""Sure... but what makes you so certain you and I would get along so well?"" ""Well..."" the woman says. ""A couple things, actually. I noticed you were wearing an Iron Maiden t-shirt. Iron Maiden are my favorite band of all time. When they went on their reunion tour in 1999, my parents took me to see them in Cleveland. I was 12 years old and it was the first concert I ever went to. I absolutely love Iron Maiden."" The man can't believe it. ""I saw them play Cleveland in '99! First concert I ever went to on my own. My best friend Jimmy Spitz and I told our parents we were sleeping at each others' houses, snuck out, took a bus into the city and saw them play at the Plain Dealer Pavillion!"" Naturally, they're both shocked. ""If that isn't weird enough..."" says the woman. ""I noticed you're reading Mark Twain. I was a communications major in university and I actually wrote my thesis on Mark Twain and how he used satire as a lens to comment on current events of the time, comparing him to satirical news sources of today. He's my favorite author."" Now the man is really taken aback, ""Get out of here! I was an English major in university! I specialized in 19th century American literature and this is like my fourth or fifth time reading Tom Sawyer, I absolutely love Mark Twain."" They both can't believe it...this has got to be a match made in heaven. ""Ok..."" the woman says. ""Well, buckle up because here's the icing on the cake. I noticed you're eating a prune. Prunes are my absolute favorite fruit. When I was a kid, my grandfather lived on a farm. He had an orchard that mainly grew apples and some lemons, but he knew how much my sister and I loved prunes so he kept a couple of plum trees. Every year at the end of the summer, we'd go up and harvest the plums with him. He'd dry them and by the time we'd go back to his place for Thanksgiving he'd always have those prunes saved just for us. They're my favorite fruit! I love prunes, you're eating a prune, this has got to be fate. What do you say?"" The man puts down his fruit and responds, *""It's a date!""*",0.0000557915,0.0000651992

So the farmer does the only logical thing, and buys the horse a guitar. Somehow, the horse learns how to play the guitar, and tours the country on talk shows, concerts, and even meeting the president. The farmer becomes rich, but still prefers the quiet of his farm, so he returns back to the farm. The horse still goes all over, now that he's been hired as a live musician for several talk shows, but he returns to the farm every so often to check in with the farmer and the farm animals. After a few months, the farmer discovers that a chicken can speak as well, and has a burning desire to play the drums. Despite the obvious punchline, the farmer buys a specialty set of drums for the chicken. The chicken forms a two animal band with the horse, and they tour the country, produce a few CD's, and make the farmer even more money. Soon, more animals, a donkey and a sheep join the band as the singer and the bassist. The chicken, sheep, and donkey are going to their next concert, but the horse flies back to the farm to find the farmer, sadly, dead in his bed. Never having experienced such deep sadness, the horse does what his human companions taught him: he goes to the bar, where he sees a newspaper that says the flight the sheep, donkey, and chicken crashed into the mountains, and none survived.

Every able lad within a few hundred miles wanted to play football for Central Catholic Fighting Knights. Those who were familiar with the program, knew that the true heart and soul of the Knights football program was Sister Mary Margaret, an aged nun who would, in full habit, get out on the practice field and work on routes with the receivers, give pointers to the quarterbacks on their stances and releases, but most of all, love them like the second mother that she became to all of the boys in that program. One year, on the eve of the state championship game, some evil malefactors broke into the convent and kidnapped Sister Mary Margaret. Everyone was stunned by the news, but none more so than the Knights of Central Catholic. They were devastated at the loss of their mentor. As you might guess, the state championship game didn't go very well. For the first time in the history of the football program, the Knights were shut out. The Spartans beat them 42-0.

1393,442,"Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help.","After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem. ""The good news is I can cure your headaches; the bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."" Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, ""That's what I need, a new suit."" He entered the shop and told the salesman, ""I'd like a new suit."" The salesman eyed him briefly and said, ""Let's see, size 44 long?"" Joe laughed, ""That's right, how did you know?"". ""It's my job."" replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit him perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about a new shirt?"" Joe thought for a moment and then said, ""Sure!"". The salesman eyed Joe, then said, ""Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and a half neck."". Joe was surprised, ""That's right, how did you know?"".

1399,440,A priest told me this joke as a kid.,"There were 3 men, they were best friends, and they were quite unhealthy. Their names were, Bert, Chester, and Earl. They were actually really unhealthy and Bert decided that he needed to take charge of him and his friends' health. He decided that they were going to be on a diet together to help them live for as long as possible. He broke the news to his friends, and they weren't too happy about it, but they decided to go along with it anyways, because they knew how out-of-shape they all were. It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age. &#x200B; One day the 3 of them were given great news. Bert got a call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: ""Guys! My daughter just had a child! I'm going to be a grandpa!"". Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got a call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said: ""Guys! My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!"". Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got a call. He answered it, turned around and said to everybody: ""Guys! My family is having a reunion today! I'm going to see so many people that I haven't seen in years!"". &#x200B; They found out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed a little the day before and the roads were a little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into a semi-truck. It killed all three of them. &#x200B; The three of them wake up together in heaven. They notice an angel standing over them and one of them asks ""Where are we?"". The angels says: ""Congratulations, you made it to heaven"". The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at a banquet. ""Here is a banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it"". Chester looks a little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, ""What's wrong?"". Chester finally speaks up, ""Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on a diet. I wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day"". The angle replies to them, ""No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it"". The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place. &#x200B; Next, the angel decides to show them a place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to a massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them, ""This is where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends"". The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him, ""What's wrong?"". Chester responds with, ""My wife left me because of my gambling problems, I don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy this area"". The angel then slightly irritated lets him know, ""Don't you see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here"". Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live. &#x200B; The angel finally takes them to the third place, and it is a huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, ""This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone"". The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice a big window on a wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least 5 miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, ""So, uh... What's the rent here?"". The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies ""Nothing? It's free"". Earl is sure to thank the angel and says, ""Wow! That's so kind of you guys!"". Bert notices that Chester is looking a little sad. Bert says, ""What's wrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?"". Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says a little mad, ""If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert. We could've been here 20 years ago!"". &#x200B;",0.0001022346,0.0000585401

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blink for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as nor mal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7."" PS : Not mine but the best I've ever heard !",0.0000786185,0.0000736831

1519,381,Benny the Bare Faced Viking," Benny was your typical Viking.. Strong, tall, courageous, he was the ideal viking in every way, except for one.. See Benny couldn't grow a beard, for all his 30 winters on Earth, he still had just as smooth a face as the day he was born. This bothered Benny, because when he was out pillaging, nobody took him serious.. Who is scared of a baby faced warrior that looks like he's 16? The final straw for Benny just happened at the last raid his opponent laughed at him and asked the Vikings to send him a man instead of a boy. Well Benny might have slain that warrior for his crass comment, but his confidence was beginning to fade. So that night, during the rioting, looting and pillaging, Benny got very, very drunk on mead and wandered out into a field. ""ODIN!"" he yelled - ""Why have you forsaken me? I've been a loyal follower, I've fought in many battles in your name.. Why have you cursed me with this face?"" It may have been a trick of the light or the many horns of mead Benny had drunk, but Benny was surprised to hear an answer back.. ""Benny! I have not forsaken you, why do you say such things?"" ""Odin, how can I be a feared warrior when I cannot grow a beard? My opponents laugh at me and call me a child! I just wish to grow a beard like yours, one such that all will know me to be a man!"" ""Very well"" Odin replied ""as you've been a good Viking, I will help you grow your beard... BUT!!!! If you ever cut or shave, I will turn you into an urn!"" ""Odin, I would never do that"" Benny replied ""All I've wanted my life is to serve you and look like a man!"" ""So be it"" Odin ""but you have been warned.."" Benny passed out into a drunken sleep to awake the next morning.. When he awoke, he thought it all a dream.. until he rubbed his face and where once was smooth skin like a babies bottom was now.. Stubble? ""Yes Odin! Thank you! I will not forget our deal!"" By the end of the day, Benny had a respectable shadow on his face.. At the end of the week, Benny's beard had come in.. At the end of two weeks, Benny's beard had continued to grow and was now down to his chest.. His life was good, he had the respect of his fellow Vikings, his opponents feared him, and Benny had never been happier.. However, his beard continued to grow at an astonishing rate.. At the end of the third week, it had grown to his waist. His fellow Vikings were muttering about black magic behind his back.. At the end of the month, it was down to his knees, and in order to go into battle, he had to tie it around himself like a belt. At the end of two months, he could no longer move without the a\*\*istance of a wheel barrow to carry his beard in front of him, he could not go into battle, and he his fellow Vikings were sure he was cursed.. Benny was despondent. He began to think to himself about how busy Odin must be.. How Odin couldn't possibly remember the agreement they had.. How Odin must have forgotten him, for how else would his beard have continued to grow so much.. Benny couldn't take it anymore.. He took his belt knife, grabbed his long beard and just as soon as his blade parted the first hair on his face... \*\*POOF!\*\* Benny was turned into an urn..

1671,315,Everyone knows good ol' Dave," Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them."" Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?"" ""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts, ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"" Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky. ""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says. ""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts. ""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."" Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else. ""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies. ""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome. Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican. Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics. Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?"" His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",0.0000419572,0.0122136706

They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, ""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader."" The gas pump, of course, didn't respond. The younger alien became angry at the lack of response. The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you.' The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response. Pissed at the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, ""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!"" The older alien again warned his comrade saying, 'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad.' 'Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch. Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head. 'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?'

1752,280,"Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest","After a few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that a vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make a plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win. Adam, already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/AskReddit. He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to a mere 38 points. Paul, a big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with a third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered ""nostalgia"" and he got downvoted into oblivion. Bill, who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found a seemingly unrelated post, and made a top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over a thousand fake internet points. Mike, who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber VI. Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory. While the other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie ""Up"". He took a picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/Jokes with the title ""STOLEN"". When the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. ""How did you know that would win?"" ""Easy,"" Chris replied. ""Everyone knows stolen content on /r/Jokes gets all the Up votes.""",0.0000598294,0.0000505708

1923,226,So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,"He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. ""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",0.0000395957,0.3374236524

The eyes pointed out that they were the ones who saw everything, including whatever objectives the brain was going to decide to pursue, so they should be in charge. The arsehole tried to say something at this point but was interrupted: The ears said that they should be in charge because not even the eyes could look in all directions at once, whereas the ears were vigilant no matter which way the body was facing, and could even warn of danger when the eyes were shut. The heart said this was all very well, but without the tireless work it did in bringing blood to all parts of the body neither the brain nor the eyes nor the ears would last half a minute, so the heart should be in charge. Again the arsehole started to speak but was shouted down. The stomach pointed out that it had to process food before the heart would have anything worth carrying around, so it ought to be in charge. The hands said that they were the ones responsible for picking up whatever the brain decided on and the eyes saw, and without them the stomach would never get anything, so they should be in charge. The legs commented that they were the ones actually responsible for taking the body from place to place, so they ought to be in charge. The arsehole made a final attempt to put its case, but everyone else told it to piss off and shut the fuck up. This upset the arsehole so it decided to go on strike and see how everyone else liked it. Pretty soon the brain was feeling faint, the eyes had spots before them, the ears were ringing, the heart was fluttering, the stomach was queasy, the hands were clammy and the legs were wobbly. They all asked the arsehole very politely to get back to work, but the arsehole said that they'd had their chance to be nice about it and there was no way it was going back to work unless it could be in charge. And while the other parts of the body tried to hold out, it soon became clear that unless the arsehole got its way things were going to just get worse and worse, so eventually there was nothing for it but to give in. And from that day to this, whenever there is a body or organisation of any sort, there's always an arsehole in charge.",0.0000377250,0.9616200924

When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again. Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away. ""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""",0.0001271322,0.9930630326

I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you. I've been finding real passion with Stacy, and she is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of her piercings, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am. But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children. Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves, and trading it with the other people in the commune, for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS, so Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it! Don't worry, Dad. I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit, so you can get to know your many grandchildren. Love, your son, Joshua. P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table. Call when it is safe for me to come home!",0.0000392819,0.0001718084

Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note.

""I'll make three predictions. If each one comes true before the day is over, you return here and pay me $50. But if all three don't come true, I will close up and never work again."" Bill laughed. ""Well what if you're wrong?"" ""I've never been wrong."" Retorted the psychic. ""It's why I'm still in business. Bill agreed, and the psychic peered into his crystal ball. ""I see it.

After examining the products, he hadn't found an appropriately amazing vibrator and asked the store clerk for help. The store clerk recommended the ""Voodoo Dick."" ""How does it work?"" asked the businessman. The clerk unwrapped the Voodoo Dick from its ceremonial tiki box and said to it, ""Voodoo Dick that door."" The vibrator flew out of the box and attacked the door with such vigor that the door split in half. ""Fantastic,"" said the man. ""I'll take it!"" He instructed his wife on how to use the Voodoo Dick and left on his business trip. Soon, his wife decided to try it out and said the magic words: ""Voodoo Dick my pussy."" The Voodoo Dick flew out of the box and gave her orgasm after orgasm. But soon it became too much, and she couldn't figure out how to make it stop. So she got into her car and began driving to the hospital, swerving so much that she got pulled over by the police. The policeman asked her why she was driving so recklessly and she explained to him that she had a Voodoo Dick inside her that wouldn't leave her alone.

2383,135,"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.","His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated. The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7."" ",0.0000675914,0.0000709336

2401,133,Stanley was killed in a freak explosion in his garage...,"There was nothing Stanley liked better than drinking beer, smoking cigarettes, and hunting. At least twice a week, Stanley went out in the woods with his hunting buddies Cletus and Jimmy. They never shot much, but they always had a few cases handy and always had a good time. They were practically inseparable and were often seen bumbling around town together. Now, one day Stanley was working out in the shed when his lit cigarette ignited a nearby gas can. The can exploded, Stanley was engulfed in flames and, tragically, died from his injuries. After the police investigation ruled the explosion an accident, his mangled body was sent to the morgue. The entire front side of his body was burned beyond recognition, but everyone in town knew that if anybody could confirm it was Stanley, it'd be Cletus and Jimmy. The mortician called Cletus in to identify the body. ""Thank you for coming in, Cletus,"" she said gently. ""I know this isn't easy for you and I appreciate you taking the time."" Cletus replied in a somber tone. ""No trouble at all, ma'am."" The mortician lifted the sheet from the body, revealing Stanley's horribly burned frontside. She asked Cletus if this was indeed Stanley. ""Weeeeeeeell,"" said Cletus. ""I don't know. I really can't tell. Why don't you flip him on over?"" The mortician was confused, but obliged, revealing Stanley's relatively unharmed naked backside. Without hesitation, Cletus exclaimed, ""Nope, that ain't Stanley!"" The mortician was surprised, but thanked Cletus again for his time and sent him on his way. She then called Jimmy to the morgue to see if he could provide a positive identification. As with Cletus, she offered her sympathies and thanked him for coming in. Then she pulled back the sheet and asked Jimmy if he could confirm it was Stanley. ""Weeeeeeell,"" Jimmy said pensively. ""Hard to say. Would it be alright if you flip him over?"" The mortician was even more surprised this time, but again obliged. After only a second, Jimmy said confidently, ""Nope, that ain't Stanley."" The mortician was dumbfounded. ""I have to ask,"" she said. ""Why on earth did you want me to flip the body over? Cletus said the exact same thing!"" Jimmy replied, ""Well you see miss, this man's only got one asshole."" ""One asshole?!"" the mortician cried. ""What's that got to do with anything?!"" ""Weeeeell you see,"" said Jimmy, ""Whenever me and Cletus and Stanley walked through town, everybody would point and say, 'There goes Stanley with them two assholes!'""",0.0006418356,0.0003569105

He ate, slept and drank tractors, his room was covered with posters of them, bed sheets, t-shirts, the whole works. He met a girl, fell in love and eventually got married. She didn't share his love of tractors quite as much and began to get upset as Alan would spend more time at tractor conventions than with her. Weekends away, and even when he was home all he talked about were tractors. One day She said ""Right! I've had enough Alan, I love you to bits, you're my whole world. But I can't go on with you spending more time with friggin tractors than with your wife"". She gave him a choice, ""It's me or the tractors Alan, what will it be?"". Alan wasn't stupid, he replied ""Of course it is you my love, I'll give up tractors, I love you."" That was the end of tractors for Alan, everything to do with them was GONE. He didn't know what to do with all his free time, so he and his Wife went for long walks through the country side, occasionally seeing a tractor or two. However he wouldn't say a word, he genuinely was not interested in them anymore. One day Alan and his wife were walking through the fields when they noticed a barn on fire, with people inside. With no time to wait for the fire brigade Alan ran down to help the people inside the barn. ""You know what to do Alan!"", screamed his wife. Alan knew exactly what to do, he ran into the barn and took in a deep breath. Inhaling all the smoke Alan ran outside and blew the smoke into the air, after doing this a few times he managed to clear the whole barn of smoke and rescue the people inside. They were amazed and very grateful to Alan for his help. ""How the hell did you do that?"" asked one of them. ""Oh no problem"" he said, I'm an ex-tractor fan"".",0.0000620384,0.0088685043

The man thought and weighed his options and saw profit so he agreed. They scheduled a baptism for the man for the next day itself. The padre splashes holy water on the man and says ""You were born a Muslim, you lived a life of a Muslim, but now you are Christian"" The baptism done everyone was happy and placed their woodwork orders with man and paid him advances.

The lawyer responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell into this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it."" The old farmer replied. ""This is my property, and your not coming over here."" The indignant lawyer replied. ""I'm one of the best trial lawyers in the UK, and if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything that you own.

The lawyer asked, ""What is the Scottish Three Kick Rule?"" The farmer replied, ""Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times, and so on, back and forth until someone gives up."" The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. The old farmer slowly gets down from the tractor and walked up to the city fella. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the lawyer's groin, which dropped him to his knees. His second kick nearly ripped the nose off his face. The lawyer was flat on his belly, when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly causing him to give up, but didn't.

The boy asked, ""What is this, Father?"" The father (never having seen an elevator) responded, ""Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don't know what it is."" While the boy and his father were watching with amazement, a fat old lady in a wheelchair rolled up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened and the lady rolled between them into a small room. The walls closed and the boy and his father watched the small circular numbers above the walls light up sequentially. They continued to watch until it reached the last number and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order. Finally the walls opened up again and a gorgeous, voluptuous 24-year-old blonde woman stepped out. The father, not taking his eyes off the young woman, said quietly to his son, ""Go get your mother."" ",0.0000558714,0.0001356847

The director would interrupt the orchestra as usual during the rehearsals to give instructions from time to time. But his advises didn't make much sense, and his hand signs looked more like a layman enjoying the music rather than a director making the orchestra keep up with the tempo. The musicians began to suspect he wasn't very bright and were sharing these views between them at a low voice. Until one of the percussionists got sick of all that nonsense. He took the drumsticks and hit the timpani as hard as he could, making a LOOOOUD bang that scared the whole orchestra.

2685,104,Too much drinking!,"Recently a routine police patrol was parked outside a bar in the Outback. After last call, the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so apparently intoxicated that he could barely walk. The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing. After what seemed an eternity, in which he tried his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it. He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off. Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off; it was a fine, dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' vehicles left. At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road. The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyser test. To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man had consumed any alcohol at all! Dumbfounded, the officer said, ""I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyser equipment must be broken."" ""I doubt it,"" said the truly proud man, ""tonight I'm the designated decoy.""",0.0001525859,0.0001698575

The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and complications from repeated pokes in the belly. He was 71. Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies and Captain Crunch. The grave site was piled high with flours. Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, he still, as a crusty old man, was considered a roll model for millions. Doughboy is survived by his wife, Play Dough; two children John Dough and Jane Dough; plus they had one in the oven. He is also survived by his elderly father Pop Tart.

2803,94,"(Long joke, continues in body) Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.","His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated. The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""",0.0000781826,0.0000709336

I took a seat and just as she was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. She made me promise not to touch the blindfold until she returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my wife was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my wife returned, apologizing for taking so long. She asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured her I had not. At this point, she removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, ""Happy Birthday!""",0.0000671946,0.0004417247

The guy says, ""I wish this desert was a beautiful kingdom, with green rolling hills, and a magnificent castle for me to live in."" Nate thinks about it and says, ""Well, that's kind of a lot. Tell ya what, I'll fulfill your final wish, but somewhere in your kingdom I'm gonna hide a lever. And if that lever is switched to the off position, all your wishes will disappear and you'll be back crawling through the desert. Is that fair?""

It's still in the on position, but next to it is the flattened corpse of the magical talking snake. One of the townspeople comes up to him and ask, ""Why? Why, m'Lord?

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?"" ""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts, ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"" Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky. ""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says. ""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts. ""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."" Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else. ""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies. ""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome. Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican. Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics. Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?"" His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",0.0001106550,0.0123798307

He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.

When he was near the ground his fall started to slow down until eventually he levitated. The Muslim, unimpressed by the Buddhist said that Allah can grant him the power of flight. So he jumped off. As he falls he calls for Allah. ""Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar."" As he nears the ground his calls became desperate. ""Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!"" The ground broke his fall. The Buddhist, while still levitating, nods to the Christian to tell him it's his turn. Surely the Lord will save me from any harm he says to himself. So he jumps off the cliff and prays to god. ""Lord Jesus Lord God Holy Spirit save me save me"" he said as he was falling. Midway to the ground he calls for the blessed mary and the saints for help. ""Saint Paul, Saint Peter, Mary please save me please save me."" As he was getting dangerously close to the ground he said; ""Oh lord jesus, god, hol- BUDDHA BUDDHA BUDDHA BUDDHA BUDDHA.""

There was no spare bed in the house--there wasn't even a sofa. So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife tapped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her. ""I couldn't do that,"" he whispered. ""Your husband is my best friend!"" ""Listen, sugar,"" she whispered back, ""there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake hime up now."" ""I can't believe that,"" Charlie said. ""Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he? ""He certainly won't. If you don't believe me, pluck a hair out of his ass and see if that wakes him."" Charlie did just that. Reached over and yanked. He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her. When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again. Again he yanked a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep. This went on eight times during the night. Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's ass hairs.

These highly classified positions are extremely difficult to fill, requiring an extensive background check, training, and testing before candidates are even considered for the position. After reviewing several applicants and completing all the checks and training, the field was narrowed to the three most promising candidates. The day came for the final test, which would determine which of equally qualified candidates, would get the job. The final candidates consisted of two men and one woman. The men administering the test took the first candidate, a man, down a corridor to a closed door and handed him a gun saying, ""We must be completely assured that you will complete your assignments and follow instructions regardless of the circumstances. Inside this room you will find your wife, seated in a chair. Take this gun and kill her."" The man, looking completely shocked said, ""You can't be serious! I could never kill my wife."" The CIA man said, ""Well, then, you're obviously not the man for the job. Take your wife and go home."" They brought the next candidate in, the other man, and repeated the instructions. This man took the gun, walked into the room and closed the door. However, after five minutes of silence, the door opened and the man handed the CIA tester the gun, saying, ""I just couldn't do it. I couldn't kill my wife. I tried to pull the trigger but I just couldn't do it."" The CIA man said, ""Well, then, you're obviously not the man for the job. Take your wife and go home."" Then they brought the woman down the corridor to the closed door, handed her a gun, and said, ""We must be completely assured that you will complete your assignments and follow instructions regardless of the circumstances. Inside this room you will find your husband, seated in a chair. Take this gun and kill him."" The woman took the gun, walked into the room, and before the door closed all the way, the CIA men heard the gun start firing. One shot after another, for thirteen shots, the noise continued. Then all hell broke loose. For the next several minutes, the men heard screaming, cursing, furniture crashing and banging on the walls; then suddenly, silence. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks! I had to beat him to death with the chair!""

3158,75,A king was going on a conquest on a faraway land,"He was going to be leaving his young wife in their castle for who knows how long. He thought to himself: ""I don't know how long i will be away but i need to make sure no one will have intercourse with my wife while i am away"". So he put a chastity belt on his wife & kept the key. He begged his wife to wait for him until he comes back. But he also thought what if he died while he was away, his wife will be lonely & will not be able to bear children. So he thought of a plan around this. He thought of his best friend, his childhood friend that he has always trusted. He thought to himself: ""Ah, i will entrust this to him, in case i will not be able to return"" So he called his best friend and entrusted the key to him. He told him: ""We have been best friends since we were little children & i trust you with my whole life, i have put a chastity belt on my wife so that no one can have intercourse with her and i am entrusting the key to you. In the event that i will not return, or if i have died in my conquest, you have my permission to use the key & make love to my wife."" His best friend accepted and told him: "" this is an honor, i will uphold your wishes"" A few hours passed & the king left his kingdom for his conquest. Shortly, he noticed someone was running behind him, he saw it was his best friend. He was surprised, and so he asked him: King: What is the matter?

These crows always post a sentry while they eat roadkill to warn them of any approaching traffic. The problem lies neither in the sentry nor the larger body of crows, but in miscommunication. The crows have learned to say ""Car! Car!"" but they have not learned how to say ""Truck! Truck!""",0.0018937665,0.0001037327

3484,62,Mrs. Parker and Baroness Von Hildebrand,"There's this woman, let's call her Mrs. Parker. She is on a flight from Frankfurt to London. She's tired, she's had a long day. She gets on the plane, goes to her seat in economy class, window seat. She makes herself comfortable and tries to get some sleep. Another woman comes and sits next to her. The other woman looks a bit odd, too much makeup, too much jewelry, too much cosmetic surgeries, you know, too much Botox, too much lip fillers. Anyway. Mrs. Parker and the lady exchange greetings and the flight takes off. As Mrs. Parker is just about to doze off, the other lady elbows her a little bit. ""Excuse me"" the woman says, ""I didn't even introduce myself. My name is Baroness Von Hildebrand."" Mrs. Parker looks at her and says, ""Uh, my name is Mrs. Parker, it's very nice meeting you Miss, Mrs... uh"" ""Baroness."" ""Oh, sorry, Baroness"" And Mrs. Parker tries to sleep again. A minute goes by and she's elbowed again. The baroness says, ""You know it's the first time I'm actually sitting in economy class. First time in my life. I've always been a first-class passenger. But today, somehow, First class is full and I really needed to be on this plane. So, here I am in economy class. To be honest, it's not too bad. I mean, I'm sitting here with the masses, with the little people, and, you know, it's nice."" Mrs. Parker looks at her and says, ""Well that's very nice, very nice."" and she tries to sleep again. Not a full minute goes by and she's elbowed again. ""By the way, you know, I'm only in this lack of luxury for this short flight to London. As soon as we arrive, my chauffeur will be waiting for me in my limousine. And I will be back in the luxuries of life that I've always known. I can't wait for that to happen."" Mrs. Parker looks on and says, ""Well that's very nice. Very nice. But, I really need to get some sleep."" and she tries to sleep again Another minute goes by and she's elbowed again. ""Do you know why I'm able to afford all these luxuries of life? It's because of my husband. My husband is the CEO of one of the top 100 companies in the world. He makes no less than a hundred million dollars a year on any given year, and so we live a wonderful, fantastic, luxurious life, every single day of our lives."" Mrs. Parker looks at her and says ""uh, well... very nice, very nice."" And tries to sleep again Some few seconds later. ""And by the way, do you have children? Mrs...? I forgot your name."" ""Mrs. Parker. Yes, I've got one son. He works in a grocery store right now. He's trying to--"" ""Yeah, well, you know, I've got two sons. My two sons are the most wonderful sons, the most wonderful kids any parent could dream of having. They're handsome. They're healthy. They're smart. They're both in their early 20s, and they're already making so much money. I love them so much, the best children in the world."" Mrs. Parker looks at her and says: ""Oh, very nice, very nice."" and tries to get some sleep again. ""By the way, I'm on vacation. This holiday started in Thailand. I went to Thailand, spent two wonderful weeks there. Then went to Bali for another two beautiful weeks, then went to the Caribbean for another two weeks, and finally went to Austria and Germany where I attended the opera and saw the most wonderful pieces of music, ballet, and opera."" ""Oh, well, that's very nice, very nice. But, I really should get some sleep now."" says Mrs. Parker. ""This whole trip that I've done, this whole vacation, this whole holiday, was paid for by my husband. It was a gift for my birthday. Every year he tries to get me a better gift. What did your husband buy you for your last birthday?"" So, Mrs. Parker looks at her and says, ""Well, we are of limited means, but for my last birthday, my husband paid for me to take some English classes."" ""English classes?! That's ridiculous! How cheap! Why would he buy you English classes? You're English, you speak English! It doesn't make any sense. Did you even learn anything from those classes?"" Mrs. Parker says ""Well, actually I did. Those classes have been quite beneficial to me. It's improved the way I speak quite a lot. For instance, before going to those english classes, I used to say 'go fuck yourself' quite a lot..."" ""...but now I say 'very nice'.""",0.0000468973,0.0000798633

3496,62,Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts,"Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero. Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost. The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick. The moral of the story - Pay your bills !!

3498,62,So there was a man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,"He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. ""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",0.0000389147,0.3374236524
3499,62,"There was an elderly couple who in their old age noticed that they were getting a lot more forgetful, so they decided to go to the doctor."," The doctor told them that they should start writing things down so they don't forget. They went home and the old lady told her husband to get her a bowl of ice cream. ""You might want to write it down,"" she said. The husband said, ""No, I can remember that you want a bowl of ice cream."" She then told her husband she wanted a bowl of ice cream with whipped cream. ""Write it down,"" she told him, and again he said, ""No, no, I can remember: you want a bowl of ice cream with whipped cream.""

He heard that his neighbor down the road had a few fine chickens for sale so he decided to walk over to see if he could strike a deal. The farmer arrives at his neighbors place and after some haggling gets a great deal on a new pullet and cock. While he is there he sees an old ass for sale and he asks the neighbor if he thinks that he could use it to haul things back on the farm. The neighbor replied that he is a good worker but occasionally he will stop and you have to scratch his belly to get him moving again. He again gets a good deal and marches off triumphantly with his pullet under one arm, cock under the other, and the reigns of his new ass in his hand. The farmer gets about halfway back to his farm when the ass stops moving. He cant scratch its belly since he would have to set down a chicken and risk it running off. Unsure what to do he sees a carriage coming down the road which he promptly beckons.

As the Japanese samurai strode into the great Hall and approached him, the emperor pulled out a box and opened it, and from it flew out a single fruit fly. Without hesitation, the Japanese samurai whips out his sword, shouts his battle cry and cuts the fly into two perfect halves. Impressed the emperor sends this samurai off. Next, the emperor brings in the Chinese samurai. Again, as the samurai approaches, he opens the fly box. The Chinese samurai swings his sword and two perfect halves fall to the ground. The emperor, impressed, sends this samurai away. Finally, it comes time for the Jewish samurai. As the samurai approaches, the emperor sets the fly free. Without hesitation, the Jewish samurai swings his sword but instead of the fly falling to the ground, it lets out an ""eep!"" and flies away.

The first was to walk barefoot across a trench filled with hot coals. The second, to drink a full quart of the most powerful spirit. Third, he had to enter a cave and, with a small set of tongs, remove a bad tooth from a vicious lioness. Lastly, he was told, he had to make love to the ugliest old crone in the village. Well, he pulled off his boots and told them to bring on the hot coals. Manfully he strode through them to the other side of the trench, where he lifted the quart of spirit and drained it, hurling the pot aside. Then he stumbled into the lioness cave. There followed the most terrible sounds of spitting, growling, banging and shrieking. The listening men found their blood growing cold. At last the warrior staggered out into the sunlight.

Listen, I'll bet you $1,000 that I can jump off the Empire State Building and survive. But if I do survive, you have to try it next."" The second guy thinks about it for a while and says, ""Okay. I'll feel pretty bad when you die, but it's a free country, and I could certainly use $1,000."" After shaking hands on the bet they both leave the bar and head to the top of the Empire State Building.

Believing the first guy would chicken out, and worried the bet has gone a little too far, the second guy lunges towards the first and tries to grab him. But it's too late. He watches the man fall for what seems like forever. Just as he's about to turn his head away from the impending disaster, he notices the first man start to slow down.

The first guy makes his way back up to the top of building and is greeted by the second guy who rushes over to him, hugs him, and says ""You're alive! That was amazing! How? What? I can't even."" The first guy says, ""See I told you! Now, how about that $1,000? And remember, we agreed that if I survived you would do it next."" The second guy nods his head and happily hands over the $1,000, feeling like it's a small investment for the money he'll make from the same bet with other people. Moments later he finds himself standing on the edge, and takes the leap. The first man watches the second falling for what seems like forever, and just then.... SPLAT...

The tribe leader was ecstatic that someone of Asian descent was at his tribe. They quickly exchanged names and the tribe leader offered to give a quick tour of the rain-forest nearby. Sato was amazed at the wildlife diversity and learnt many new things about African flora and fauna. The tribe leader was happy that his guest was enjoying his time. About ten more minutes of walking, they encountered a cave; it was pitch black. Sato tried to make out any figures or objects in the cave but light only shone in about a few meters. ""Toot toot toot,"" the tribe leader called out in a deep and nonchalant voice. The tribe leader edged towards the cave and cup his hand around his ear, awaiting a response. ""Toot toot toot,"" a slightly higher pitched voice called back. The tribe leader quickly took off all his clothes and dashed into the cave, leaving Sato shocked and confused. About five minutes later, the tribe leader strolled out, sweating all over and panting in exhaustion. ""What in the world just happened?!"" Sato asked frantically. The tribe leader laughed as he slowly put on his clothes. ""We have a interesting culture here in this area; when you see a cave, you must call out like me and wait for a reply. If you hear reply, it mean that there are a beautiful woman inside wanting to have the sex and you must run in swiftly!"" Sato was taken aback; he has never heard anything like it! The next day, he trekked alone into the mountain side and came across a smaller rain-forest where wet leaves littered the ground from a storm that morning. The tribe leader's words echoed in his mind and his curiosity was at an all time high; would the same thing happened? The damp atmosphere was relaxing as he briskly explored the rain-forest, capturing the beautiful African nature around him. Lo and behold, right next to the mountains was an extremely huge cave that stood about two to three times his height. He was exhilarated! A cave this huge must mean many women who could be bustier or more sexually active. He put down his belongings and called out as loud as he could, ""Toot toot toot!"" He paused and listened. But there was no reply. ""Toot toot toot!!"" He called even louder. Again, silence. Sato was furious, he refused to be robbed of this golden opportunity. He took a gulp of water and braced for the loudest call of his life. ""TOOT TOOT TOOT!"" Almost immediately, the cave shrieked back in an extremely solemn voice that was twice as loud. **""TOOT TOOT TOOT!""** Sato was on cloud nine, he tore through his clothes with utmost joy and sprinted into the cave.

3628,57,So there's a forest,"And a fly was hovering inside the forest. But a fish was watching the fly and thinking ""once that fly goes down 6 inches down. im gonna catch the fly to have myself a really nice meal. "" But what he did not realize is that a bear was watching the fish watching the fly and thinking ""once that fish catches the fly, im gonna catch the fish to have myself a really nice meal. "" But what the bear did not realize is that a hunter was watching him watching the fish watching the fly, and thinking ""once that fly goes down 6 inches and the fish gets the fly and the bear gets the fish"" im gonna shoot the bear to have myself a really nice meal. But what the hunter did not notice is that the mouse is watching the hunter's sandwich watching the bear watching the fish watching the fly, thinking ""once that hunter shoots the bear and drops the sandwitch im gonna go to the sandwich to have myself a really nice meal"". But what the mouse did not realize is that a cat was watching him, watching the sandwich, watching the bear watching the fish, watching the fly, thinking ""once that mouse dives in to the sandwich im gonna catch the mouse to have myself a really nice meal"". Then this is where it starts, the fly finally goes down 6 inches the suddenly the fish catches it then the bear immediately lunges to the fish, until the hunter shoots the bear and drops the sandwich which made the mouse dive in to the sandwich to have a nice meal, then this is where it all went wrong, just as the cat was about to jump at the mouse to eat it, he accidentally missed his landing and landed at the lake instead. And i think we all can get a valuable life lesson here. No matter where you are, What you are, Who you are, When a fly goes down 6 inches, A pussy's gonna get wet. ",0.0000380393,0.8580990434

The two burst inside her home and immediately get hot and heavy. They make love everywhere and in all kinds of positions.

His people believed a man's strength and courage came from his beard, and thus the man with the biggest beard was their chief. After leading the band for many years, Benny began to fell uncomfortable wearing the beard, in this hot and dusty land. He wanted to shave it off, so he called his council together to get their advice. When he said he wanted to shave, the councilmen were shocked. One said, ""Do you not remember the ancient legend, Sire. The leader who removes his beard is cursed and made into a piece of earthenware."" Benny had heard this legend, but being a modern man, he scoffed at the tale. Being headstrong, he went ahead and cut and scraped away his once magnificent beard. As the final whisker was cut off, a huge dust storm came up. It lasted only a few seconds and when it cleared, there was a man-sized clay vessel where only moments before had stood their leader. The council then knew the legend must be true. Their conclusion? ""A Benny shaved is a Benny urned.""",0.0003377546,0.0014123712

He asks if he could possibly stay the night, and the Chinese man says he can ""But..."" he warns ""My daughter is very beautiful, and if you lay a finger on her I will inflict upon you the worst three tortures China has ever produced."" The man assures him he won't touch his daughter, and is invited in for a meal before bed. As he sits down to eat, he sees the daughter and she isn't just beautiful, she is the most stunning woman he has ever laid eyes upon. He tries subtly flirting with her, and after dinner she whispers in his ear ""Join me in my room when my father falls asleep."" The man can't help himself, and that night sneeks into her room for several hours of lovemaking, before returning to his own. When he wakes up, he feels a pressure on his chest, and notices it's a huge rock. He sees a note that says ""Chinese torture no.1: rock on chest."" Shrugging, and figuring these tortures aren't going to be so bad, he stands up, casually tossing the rock out of the window and down the ravine in defiance. It is then he notices a second note on the windowsill ""Chinese torture no.2: rock tied to balls."" Seeing a thin bit of wire unspooling as the rock falls, the man decides broken legs are better than castration, and leaps out of the window. He sees a large banner on the floor below simply reading ""Chinese torture no.3: cock tied to bedpost.""",0.0000476242,0.0317204408

They snuck up one night, and in their masses, surrounded the sleeping calf, and swam away, carrying him miles away from his father. Safe to say, when the whale awoke, he was distraught. He swam and swam, searching everywhere, but to no avail. 'WHERE IS MY SON' he bellowed, disturbing fish everywhere. This distress caught the attention of a wise old sea turtle. 'I saw your son', said the turtle swimming over to the whale, 'he was kidnapped by krill. I think I can take you to him' Grateful, the whale accepted this offer, and the pair set out, searching hastily. After many hours of fruitless looking, they came to a large white cloud, and they came to a stop. The turtle looked sombre. 'I have bad news', he said mournfully. 'The krill have used their surprisingly adequate war skills once again. They have lactated so much, that they have created this giant, impenetrable white cloud. It's so wide, so high, so thick. I'm so sorry, but it's over.' The whale would not accept this. 'I'll swim through it! He said' 'No', returned the turtle. The milk is bizarrely poisonous for whales. 'Okay then, we'll wait for it to disperse, then we can go after them again!', the wale countered 'It will take days!' cried the turtle. The cloud is miles wide, and miles thick. There's no hope. 'Alright then, can't I go over it, can't I even look over it?', the whale nearly sobbed in desperation. The turtle looked him dead in the eye. 'You don't understand. There's no use spying over krill milk'",0.0005626828,0.0003937148

Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet.. ""How can you be so sure?"" she protested.. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something."" The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.. The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!"" The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.""",0.0004274150,0.0002207838

4131,43,Ladder to Success,"A man falls asleep one night with depressing thoughts of his failures in life; never has he been able to provide for his family what he wants them to have. He wakes up the next morning on the floor of a room with only a white painted ceiling and floor. No walls. Just clouds as far as he can see. In the middle of the room, there is a ladder with a sign next to it that says, ""Climb this ladder to success."" He thinks, *why not*, and begins to climb. When he steps off onto the next floor, he sees the room he is now in has a single bed and nothing more than the ladder he stepped off of and another sign that says, ""Climb this ladder to success."" He decides to continue climbing. On the next floor, he sees a single bed next to a nightstand with a $20 bill on it. He ponders for a moment, but then decidees to continue climbing. Again, another sign: ""Climb this ladder to success."" As he climbs, each floor becomes more elaborate and his emotions start running high. *Is this his chance? Can this be true? Can he really find success by climbing this ladder?* After he climbs for what feels like an eternity, he pauses to catch his breath. He stops in a room adorned with beautiful furniture. Silk sheets cover a massive bed. Columns made of marble corner the wall-less room. A chandalier of diamonds hangs from the ceiling over the bed. And everything is adorned with gold. *This could be it!* But he notices the ladder hasn't reached the top yet and there is still a sign that says, ""Climb this ladder to success."" *What could be futher up!?* He must find out. So he continue to climb. After what seems like hours, and seeing beautiful things he could never imagine on each floor he passes, he finally reaches the top of the ladder. In front of him, there is a sign with an arrow pointing ahead. It says, ""This way to success."" He looks further ahead and sees a giant throne. Sitting on the throne is a giant naked man; the ugliest and most repulsive man he's ever seen. He approaches the throne and asks, ""Are you the one who can lead me to success? The grotesque beast of a man replies, ""Nay, you are already here."" With a smirk and a wink, the beastly figure says, ""I'm Cess."" :) *(Just for FYI, this joke delivers better if spoken.)*",0.0000668424,0.0056434441

4229,41,Just heard this variation on an oldie!,"A hat maker was trying to sell his hats on a hot summers day. After having no luck for 4 hours under the sun, he decided to take a short rest underneath a gigantic tree. He set his briefcase of hats down, took one out to cover his face, and laid down on the grass. With the shade from his hat and the warmth of the ground beneath him, he felt drowsy and quickly fell asleep. When he woke up an hour later, he was startled to find that his briefcase was open, and his hats were missing. He then heard a curious sound above him. only to notice that the tree was filled with chatty monkeys all wearing his hats! He quickly tried offering them sticks or dropped fruits in exchange for his hats, but the monkeys seemed to only make fun of him. Furious, he threw a stick at one of the monkeys, which resulted in a shower of thrown sticks back at him. Ducking for cover, he backed off to another nearby tree where he thew his hat down in frustration. To his amazement, the monkeys, seemingly copying him, threw their hats down as well! He quickly picked up his hats and ran away. The hat maker went on to have a very successful business, getting married and having many children and eventually grandchildren. He passed on his knowledge of the trade to his oldest son before retiring, who upheld the family business and eventually passed it on to his oldest son as was tradition. &nbsp; A few generations passed, and the new owner and grandson of the hat maker was selling hats on a hot day, when he too decided to take a short rest underneath a very similar tree. One thing lead to another, and he found himself waking up to his hats having been stolen by monkeys!

The jar is quite large and full to the brim with what must be thousands of $100 bills. Excited, he asks, ""What are the three tasks?"" The bartender says, ""Well, first you have to drink three straight pints of whiskey without throwing up. That's three entire pints, mind you. Most people can't do it."" ""Okay,"" the man says, clearly seeing that this is dangerous but doable, ""what's the second task?"" ""Through this door, I have a pet alligator, and he has a sore tooth. It's been bothering him for ages. You need to pull his tooth for me."" ""Holy shit,"" the man says, ""alright, well, what's the third task?"" ""My granny lives upstairs, so I can take care of her.

The man thinks very hard about these tasks, then nods his head, takes out a fresh, crisp $100 bill and stuffs it into the jar. The bartender pours the three pints of whiskey, which the man promptly starts drinking. It takes him a minute or so, and he nearly vomits, but manages to keep them down. He then goes through the doorway, stumbling slightly, to the alligator room. An immense howling is soon heard, grunting, scratching, and some of most painful and excruciating sounds the bartender has ever heard.

Many years ago the people of Mercy used to collect the fur of the Koala Bears that frequented the area, sadly there are now very few Koalas left - however at that time it was quite easy to collect the fur and the local people used the fur to make clothing and other useful stuff. They also found that is was possible to make a tasty but strong type of tea from the fur. For a while this was rather popular so they thought that perhaps an export business would bring in some much needed cash. Unfortunately the tea was not at all popular due to the presence of the fur which unlike normal tea leaves didn't fall to the bottom of the cup but remained suspended in the liquid... This of course occurred because the Koala tea of Mercy was not strained.",0.0005102166,0.0000408217

4472,36,The Blind Pilots," The general was confined to the military hospital for treatment of a minor malady. For almost a week, he made a complete nuisance of himself, irritating both staff and the other patients, demanding attention and expecting his every order to be followed immediately. He was in a six-man ward rather than a private room. His meals were too cold or not served to suit his taste, the light needed to be adjusted to his demands, the nighttime activities interfered with his rest... and on, and on. One afternoon, an orderly entered the room. ""Time to take your temperature, General."" After growling at the orderly, the general opened his mouth to accept the thermometer. ""Sorry, General, but for this test we need your temperature from the other end."" A whole new barrage of verbal abuse followed, but the orderly was insistent that a rectal temperature was what the test called for.The general at last rolled over, bared his rear, and allowed the orderly to proceed. The orderly then told the general, ""Stay exactly like that and don't move. I'll be back in five minutes to check up on you"" and withdrew .An hour later, the head nurse entered the room, saw the general with his bare rear in the air and gasped, ""What's going on here?""

After extensive scans and tests the doctor calls him in and gives him the bad news. ""I'm very sorry sir, you have a very rare case in which your nuts press up against the base of your spine which, in turn, is causing you these headaches."" So the man asks what can be done, and the doctor responds regretfully that the only solution he can think of is to cut off his balls. The man is understandably upset but decides that there is nothing to be done and he can't live with these headaches any longer and so they schedule the surgery. The day of the surgery arrives, and everything goes smoothly. In recovery, the doctor sees the man is very depressed his jewels are gone for good and goes up to him to try and cheer him up. ""You know, just outside the hospital there is a very good tailer, why don't you give him a visit and get yourself some new clothes to feel better?"" The guy agrees that this might make him feel a little better and after getting discharged walks into this little tailor shop next to the hospital. As he walks in he hears, ""size 7 hat!"" Looking around he spots a diminutive old man in a tweed vest peering at him. ""What did you say?"" asks the man. ""I said size 7 hat, that is your hat size, no?"" answered the tailor. ""Well I don't know, I was never really a hat man, how did you know?"" ""I have been doing this for 55 years. I can look at someone for a few seconds and tell you all their measurements!"" The man, disbelieving, decides to put this claim to the test. ""Oh yeah? What's my shoe size?"" ""42,"" came the prompt response. ""Shirt size?"" ""18."" 'Incredible,' thinks the man, 'this guy is good!' ""What about my pants size?"" ""44,"" came the answer. ""Aha!"" exclaimed the man, ""I have worn size 42 pants my whole life!""

After picking out the perfect bike the dealer warns him that if he leaves his Harley in the rain the chrome has a tendency to rust. He tells the young man an old biker's trick is to keep a jar of Vaseline handy and smear it on the chrome if the bike must be left out in the rain. A few months later the young man meets a woman and falls in love. She asks him to come home and meet her parents over dinner. He readily agrees and the date is set. At the appointed time he picks her up on his Harley and they ride to her parents house. Before they go in she tells him that they have a family tradition that whoever speaks first after dinner must do the dishes. After a delicious dinner everyone sits in silence waiting for the first person to break and get stuck doing the dishes. After a long fifteen minutes the young man decides to speed things up so he reaches over and kisses the woman in front of her family. And no one says a word...! Next he decides to take a more direct approach so he throws her on the table and has sex with her in front of everyone. And still no one says a word...!!! Now he is getting desperate, so he grabs her mother and throws her on the table. They have even wilder sex. But no one says a word...!!!! By now he is getting very worried and is wondering what to do next when he hears thunder in the distance. His first thought is to protect the chrome on his Harley, so he reaches in his pocket and pulls out the Vaseline. And the father says, ""Okay dammit, I'll do the dishes.""",0.0003467052,0.9660257101

4587,34,The Misplaced Frog,"The residents of the small English village of Clara Vale awoke one morning to the sound of a very loud croaking noise. Confused, the townsfolk got out of bed and traced the sound to the nearby Tyne river, where they spotted something incredible - an enormous frog, possibly the largest ever, sitting on a huge lily pad. At first, the townsfolk wanted to get rid of the frog, as its loud croaking would soon drive everyone crazy. But since it was just so uncommonly large, they all agreed to keep it as a tourist attraction instead. However, after a day of endless croaking and a sleepless night for all of Clara Vale, the town knew that they just had to get rid of it. Unfortunately though, every time someone attempted to capture the frog, it would hop into the water, only to return to its lily pad and resume its loud croaking not long after. After many days of incessant croaking, a person decided to dive into the river and capture the frog that way; unfortunately the frog was just way too fast. However, just before the diver gave up, he noticed something sitting at the bottom of the river - a collar with an address tag on it! The diver handed in the collar to the local police, and, after they inspected it, they knew that it must have been attached the frog. The police drove to the address on the collar's tag and knocked on the house door. A very ashamed-looking old man hobbled out. ""Sir."" said one of the policeman. ""We have been notified that the enormous frog that has become such a nuisance belongs to you. We found its collar in the river."" The guilty old man, starting to cry, confessed. ""He escaped!"" the old man wailed. ""The frog on the Tyne is all mine, all mine! The frog on the Tyne is all mine!""",0.0003686007,0.0002969729

He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community..."," If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy but if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave. The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate. However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate. On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Rabbi pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy! Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!"" Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. ""I don't have a clue!!!"" the Rabbi said. ""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here."" ""And then what?"" asked a woman. ""Who knows!!"" said the Rabbi.

She had several hundred young pullets and ten roosters to fertilise the eggs. &#x200B; She kept records and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced. &#x200B; This took a lot of time, so she bought some tiny bells and attached them to her roosters. Each bell had a different tone, so she could tell from a distance which rooster was performing. Now, she could sit on the porch and fill out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells. &#x200B; Sarah's favourite rooster, old Butch, was a very fine specimen but, this morning she noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! When she went to investigate, she saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets hearing the roosters coming, would run for cover. &#x200B; To Sarah's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring. He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job, and walk on to the next one. &#x200B; Sarah was so proud of old Butch, she entered him in a Show and he became an overnight sensation among the judges. &#x200B; The result was the judges not only awarded old Butch the ""No Bell Peace Prize"" they also awarded him the ""Pulletsurprise"" as well. &#x200B; Clearly old Butch was a politician in the making. &#x200B; Who else but a politician could figure out how to win two of the most coveted awards on our planet by being the best at sneaking up on the unsuspecting populace and screwing them when they weren't paying attention? &#x200B; Vote carefully in the next election.

4924,29,"Once upon a time, there was a trainee fortune teller...","Once upon a time, there was a trainee fortune teller called Sarah who hoped to learn the proper skills of divination by training alongside a renowned fortune teller, Madame Lointain (for, in these times, it was customary for each village to have a fortune teller). After having studied for many months and having completed all the necessary readings of varied tomes, Sarah was taught the most simple forms of fortune telling - reading the future from tea leaves in a cup, or the casting of chicken bones - but it wasn't until two years of studying that she finally graduated to the most renowned tool of all fortune tellers, the crystal ball. Madame Lointain explained the process to her. First an old sack cloth needed to be laid across the table, then the crystal ball was placed on the cloth. Finally the fortune teller should touch the crystal ball lightly with the very tip of their fingers and allow the divination to flow through them. When this process was complete, the crystal ball would cloud before showing the user a vision of the future. Sarah followed the steps and touched the crystal ball. There was a tingling sensation, the ball clouded, and she had the briefest of visions of herself as a fortune teller in her own village. ""Congratulations!"" said Madame Lointain ""You have passed the final test of fortune telling - the test of scrying - which means you are no longer a trainee but instead are a fully qualified fortune teller!"" Sarah was extremely pleased and immediately returned to her village, where she began preparing her house for her new business. She bought candles and incense, she bought a one-eyed cat and a toad, and she bought a set of good china, and the finest crystal ball she could find. Then she went to the market stall, where traders from Eastern lands sold their wares, and looked for a cloth to go beneath the crystal ball. Sarah decided that an old sack cloth would look very shabby beneath her beautiful new crystal ball and instead found herself taken by a beautiful purple fabric on one of the stalls. ""What kind of fabric is this?"" she asked. ""Why, you have an eye for quality,"" said the trader with a smile. ""For this is made from the finest milled silk. It is good enough for royalty in fact."" Well, that swayed Sarah completely and she purchased the fabric and completed the set up of her business. She was ready to open to the public, finally. To begin with, it was an immense success. She tossed chicken bones, she stirred tea leaves, but when she finally came to the climax of her display she found herself unable to see anything in the crystal ball. She strained, she pleaded inwardly, but it remained clear without a hint of cloudiness. Sarah made an excuse and gave her customer a refund, seeing them off with a smile, but was terribly worried. She was *sure* that she had done everything properly but it was no use, she was no longer able to scry. In floods of tears, she sent a message to Madame Lointain pleading for help and shut up shop while she waited. Three days later there was a knock at the door. Madame Lointain stepped inside and Sarah explained how she had lost the ability to successfully use the crystal ball. Firstly, Madame Lointain checked the crystal ball but it was in perfect working order. For a moment she was slightly bewildered as to what could be wrong, but then she noticed the purple fabric on the table beneath it. ""Where is the sack cloth?"" she asked. ""Oh,"" said Sarah, ""I thought this was more beautiful. It is finest milled silk, good enough for royalty."" ""Ah, well that explains it,"" said Madame Longtain with a sigh. ""It does?"" asked Sarah. ""Of course!"" said Madame Longtain, ""Haven't you ever heard it's no use scrying over milled silk?""",0.0000504455,0.0000526228

4948,28,The Computer Nerd and His Apprentice,"So, I have a story about a wise old computing nerd and his new technological apprentice. He wanted to tell his young child some core life morals, as well as teach about old technology. The wise man first showed the kid a polaroid camera. The kid quickly took it, and snapped a photo, but was very confused when the picture did not immediately show. The kid did everything to the picture to try and make it develop, but it didn't speed up, and when the photo did develop, the photo was fuzzy and unreadable. The wise old man put his hand on the shoulder, and told his apprentice that ""memories take a long time to form, but are very fickle."" The wise old man then showed the kid a flip phone, and the kid immediately tried to send a text, but the cell phone didn't send messages very well. He was eventually unable to send messages due to reaching a bandwidth limit. The kid seemed confused, but once again, the wise old man put his hand on the kid's shoulder, and told them that ""Sometimes, it is better to say a little than it is to say a lot."" Finally, the wise old man showed the kid a fax machine, which the kid almost immediately recognized. He tried to use the built-in scanner to copy a drawing he had made earlier, but yet the scanner would not print the image. The kid began to cry. Seeing an opportunity for a very important lesson, the man told them to keep crying, if for a little bit, and try again. The kid, still distraught and confused, decided to oblige. The scanner did not print once again. The man then told the kid to stop crying, and try one more time. Of course, the scanner did not work. At this point, the kid decided to read the error in detail, and saw it was out of paper. Refilling the paper, the scan went flawlessly. The man put his hand on his shoulder of the kid, and told his apprentice that ""Fax don't care about your feelings"".",0.0253268145,0.0002975389

5058,27,A traveler was walking along the side of the road hitchhiking on a dark night in the middle of a thunderstorm,"Time passed slowly and no cars went by. It was raining so hard he could barely see his hand in front of his face. Suddenly he saw a car approaching, moving slowly and appearing ghost-like in the rain. It slowly and silently crept toward him and stopped. Wanting a ride very badly, the guy jumped into the car and closed the door; only then did he realize that there was nobody behind the wheel, and no sound of the engine to be heard over the rain. Again the car crept slowly forward and guy was terrified, too scared to think of jumping out and running. The guy saw that the car was approaching a sharp curve and, still too scared to jump out, he started to pray and beg for his life. He was certain the ghost car would go off the road and into the river, and he would surely drown! But just before the curve, a shadowy figure appeared at the driver's window and a hand reached in and turned the steering wheel, guiding the car safely around the bend. Then, just as silently, the hand disappeared through the window and the hitchhiker was alone again. Paralyzed with fear, the guy watched the hand reappear every time they reached a curve. Finally the guy, frightened nearly to death, had all he could take and jumped out of the car and ran through the storm to the nearby town. Wet and in shock, he went into a lighted tavern and with voice quavering, ordered two shots of whiskey, and then, shaken, he told everybody about his supernatural experience. A silence came over those listening and everybody got goose bumps. They realized the guy was sober and was telling the truth. And the sounds of the storm continued outside. About a half hour later, two guys walked into the bar and one says to the other, 'Look Billy Bob, there's that idiot that rode in our car while we was pushing it in the rain.' &#x200B;",0.0000501338,0.0144914268

Just you go ahead and finish your meal, Sonny!' For lunch the old man made hamburgers. Again, John was concerned about the plates, as his appeared to have tiny specks around the edge that looked like dried egg and asked, 'Are you sure these plates are clean?' Without looking up the old man said, 'I told you before, Sonny, those dishes are as clean as cold water can get them. Now don't you fret, I don't want to hear another word about it!' Later that afternoon, John was on his way to a nearby town and as he was leaving, his grandfather's dog started to growl, and wouldn't let him pass. John yelled and said, 'Grandfather, your dog won't let me get to my car'. Without diverting his attention from the football game he was watching on TV, the old man shouted!

The television game show was being recorded - they do a whole week at a time, and this was the wrap-up. I was in the hot seat for the last big question. The host turned to me, and read the question slowly and carefully. But I didn't know the answer! Fortunately, I had a backup plan (there was no way I was missing out on this million bucks!). I haven't figured out how to do the fingers-in-the-mouth bit, but still manage to make a pretty piercing whistle. From the back of the stage, four mounted knights-in-armor appeared, waving their lances threateningly at the show's host. Little did I know HIS hidden talents... The host looked scared for a moment, and then a steely look came over him. He leapt into the air, and karate kicked the first knight onto the floor. He picked up the lance from the stricken knight, and fought off the second, who also fell sprawling on the floor. The second knight's horse shied, and bolted, colliding with the third knight in the process. The game show host was just beginning to enjoy himself now. He waved the spear he was still carrying at the fourth knight, looked back me, and said... ""Is that your final lancer?""",0.0000422728,0.0001938912

The pilot and copilot finally appear in the rear of the plane and begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle. Both appear to be blind; the pilot is using a white cane, bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle. The copilot is using a guide dog. Both have their eyes covered with sunglasses. At first, the passengers do not react thinking that it must be some sort of practical joke. After a few minutes though, the engines start revving, and the airplane begins moving down the runway. The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness. They start whispering among themselves and look desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance. Yet, the plane starts accelerating rapidly, and people begin panicking. Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and more hysterical. When the plane has less than twenty feet of runway left, there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once. At the very last moment, the plane lifts off and is airborne. Up in the cockpit, the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and tells the pilot: **""You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream, and we aren't going to know when to take off!""**",0.0007779062,0.0000906696

The bartender comes with the man's rum and coke and is intrigued by the little piano man. The bartender also asks what ""that pot"" is. ""A genie's lamp,"" says the man. So the bartender goes ahead and rubs the lamp. Out comes a genie. ""Make a vish"" says the genie. ""Um okay, let me get a million bucks!"" The genie disappears and the bartender waits.

5763,19,The long-tongued desert cow,"So a man was lost, wandering alone in an inhospatible desert. He wandered for what seemed like days, and was by this point very thirsty and quite hungry. As if in answer to his cries for help, he sees in the distance a small tent with a long rope leading up into the air, and another small tent floating there very high above it. Surely, this second tent in the air must be a mirage, but the first one on the ground seems real enough. The man staggers up to the tent, trying not to think too hard about the second tent up in the air, or the odd pink rope that he can plainly see extending down into a small hole in the ground. When he gets close enough, he can see a withered old couple sitting next to a withered old cow with its face buried in the sand and rocks. The old couple, surprised to see a stranger this far out in the desert, hurry to help the man into the shade of the tent. Let's give him a glass of whey, they say in unison. The man, quite sure now that this tent at least is not a mirage, feels a sudden revulsion at the thought of drinking a glass of whey. Please, says the man, do you have any water? Not much water in the desert, the old couple reply in unison. How do you live here with no water? the man asks. Well, you see, the couple explains, we have a long-tongued desert cow, she sticks her tongue way down underground to where there is water. We milk, her, but since she eats very little, the milk comes out as only whey. In response to this commentary, the cow flicks an ear and swats at an insect with her tail. I'm sorry, the man says, but I'm afraid I might throw up if I try to drink a glass of whey. I don't mean to snub your generosity. Don't you have anything else I could drink? Or is there a well nearby? The only other person for many miles is our neighbors in the tent floating above ours. The strange couple say in unison. The man looks up, finally acknowledging the tent floating in the air. You can see their long-tongued desert cow's tongue reaching down into that hole in the ground right there. They live off nothing but whey as well. Feeling delirious from exposure, the man asks one more time... So there's nothing else to drink? &amp;#x200B; And the old couple reply... &amp;#x200B; It's either our whey... or the high whey.",0.0080507426,0.0002055326

This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again. Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms. The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let alone catch it! The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50! However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on behalf of him. In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers; ""Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected. I will sell them to you at $35 and when the man returns from the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each."" The villagers rounded up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys.

People begin calling him ""Bic Jesus"" Everywhere he went, crowds would gather to see him perform his Montblanc mastery. Men wanted to be him, and women wanted to be with him. This all changed one fateful spring day. The magician arrived in Barcelona to perform the last show in this seasons tour, only to find out that he hadn't sold a single ticket yet. Devastated, he took to the streets to perform and hopefully drum up some interest in his show. Everywhere he went the people would hardly look at him, no one would shake his hand, watch his performance, or even acknowledge his increasingly desperate carnival barker-esque calls for attention. No one gave any attention to his tricks, not the moving mark, the blinking blot, or the blue to black bamboozle. The magician gave up late afternoon when he got hungry and found an old man with a food cart. Frustration was visible on the magicians face so the old man asks ""what's got you down?"", the magician responds ""I've been selling out shows throughout Europe but here people won't even take 30 seconds to watch my Stupefying Signature trick, no one will shake my hand or even look at me, if I'd have known I would never have come here"". The old man smiled kindly and told him ""do not be hard on yourself, there's no way you could have known, my friend"" ""Why do you say that?"" inquired the magician?

5808,19,A sucessful business man retires,"A successful business man in NYC finally decided to retire. After years of making it big in the stock market, years of wild parties, and years of living the city life, he packs up and moves to rural Montana. He's sick of the busy city, so he picks a very remote house in a very secluded rural area. His closest neighbor is 3 miles away, and his mail/groceries are delivered once a week. He never has to see anyone again. He spends his time reading books, enjoying the nature, and in general enjoying his time alone. One day his doorbell rings, and he opens his door to a large, rough looking man. The man let's him know that his name is Lars, and he's his neighbor from about 5-6 miles up the road. He's having a party on Saturday, and the man is invited. ""This sounds great!"" the man thinks to himself. ""I've been here alone these past few months, and I'm starting to get a little lonely. Meeting the rest of the neighbors sounds like a pretty good time."" He says yes, and Lars is very happy to hear so. Before he goes, Lars gives him a warning: ""Just so you know, there's probably going to be some poker or other card games. I don't know how you feel about gambling, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" The man, having gone to a weekly guys poker night in his life in NYC, says he's totally fine with it. Lars speaks up again: ""Also, there's probably going to be some drinking. Lots of drinking. I don't know how you feel about alcohol, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" The man hasn't been drunk much since he left NYC, thinks it'll be a great change of pace, and says that sounds good! Lars speaks up one last time: ""There's a good chance there's going to be a lot of sex. These parties can get a little out of hand. I don't know how you feel about orgies, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" After his wild life in NYC, the man is no stranger to wild sexual experiences, and after several months of no sex, he agrees. Lars seems pleased, and turns to leave. The man stops him and asks: ""Wait, you forgot to tell me what time on Saturday."" Lars replies: ""You can swing by anytime you want. It's just going to be the two of us.""",0.0000654523,0.0024020362

The genie asks, "" Your husband is now far more attractive than you'll ever be, does that not concern you?"" ""No,"" she responds, ""for I am the prettiest woman alive; he will only have eyes for me"". Then, she had an idea. An evil, cunning idea, and a dark smile curled her lips.

The librarian complies and puts a few books down. The chicken takes them and leaves. The next day, the librarian looks up to find the same chicken handing back the pile of books. 'Book! Book! Book!' says the chicken. The librarian takes the books and hands the chicken a few more. The chicken takes them and leaves. The next day, the librarian looks up once again to find the chicken handing back the second pile of books. 'Book! Book! Book!' says the chicken. The librarian shakes his head and hands him yet another pile of books. The chicken takes them and leaves. Wondering what the chicken could possibly want so many books for, the librarian decides to follow the chicken home. Through the carpark, down several roads, and finally into a large park; the chicken disappears into a small grove of trees, and the librarian follows. On the other side of the trees is a small pond. The chicken stops at the side of the pond, and there he hands the books to a frog. The frog picks each book up in turn, looking at the titles, saying 'reddit... reddit... reddit....'

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?"" ""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts, ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"" Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky. ""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says. ""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts. ""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."" Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else. ""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies. ""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome. Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican. Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics. Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?"" His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",0.0000421828,0.0123798307

When the Madam answered, she saw the little boy and asked what he wanted. He said, ""I want to have sex with one of the women inside. I have the money and I'm not leaving until I do."" The Madam figured, why not, so she told him to come in. Once in, she told him to pick any of the girls he liked. He asked, ""Do any of the girls have any diseases?"" Of course, the Madam said no. He said,""I heard all the men talking about having to get shots after making it with Amber. THAT'S the girl I want!"" Since the little boy was so adamant and had the money to pay for it, the Madam told him to go to the first room on the right. He headed down the hall dragging the squashed frog behind him. Ten minutes later he came back, still dragging the frog, paid the Madam, and headed out the door. The Madam stopped him and asked, ""Why did you pick the only girl in the place with a disease, instead of one of the others?"" He said, ""Well, if you must know, tonight when I get home, my parents are going out to a restaurant to eat, leaving me at home with my baby-sitter. After they leave, my baby-sitter will have sex with me because she just happens to be very fond of little boys. She will get the disease that I just caught. When Mom and Dad get back, Dad will take the baby-sitter home. On the way, he'll jump the baby-sitter's bones, and he'll catch the disease. Then when Dad gets home from the baby-sitters, he and Mom will go to bed and have sex, and Mom will catch it. In the morning when Dad goes to work, the Milkman will deliver the milk, have a quickie with Mom and catch the disease, because that damn mailman is the son-of-a-bi\*ch who ran over my FROG!""

So what's your story?"" So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this naked man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died right then and there on the balcony."" ""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. ""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and one of my favorite hobbies is dancing around naked while eating pickles out of a glass jar. As I was doing so the other day, I slipped on an errant pickle and slipped over the balcony. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but thankfully I fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. I thought I was the luckiest guy in the world, but a refrigerator fell out of the sky and crushed me to death!"" Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. The man responds: ""I died naked inside a refrigerator.""",0.0000496302,0.0007864416

6200,17,A man went to school to be an engineer...,"But after 4 years and lots of hard work, he discovered he couldn't find a job in his field. Deeply in debt, he took on a job at a mortuary. He liked the work alright, but was annoyed by how tedious and inefficient the place was. The week after he started, there was a terrible accident. There was an explosion at a propane storage facility and several of the victims were dismembered in the blast. The funeral home was swamped with work and his boss told him ""Look, I know you're not fully trained yet but we really need your help so just do the best you can."" He thought to himself, ""Finally, a chance to show the boss how efficiently I can work and how much better his business could be run!"" Being the low man on the totem pole, he was given the task of finding the correct body parts and placing them together. This was very difficult and was taking him quite a while to accomplish, so he came up with a solution to get it done on his own more efficient schedule. He grouped the body parts of one type all together. All the heads in one place, all the arms in another, and all the legs in another, and he cleaned and dressed them up assembly line style one type of limb at a time and then placed them in their respective coffins. Later, at the group funeral service, the widow of one of the victims was inconsolable and said that she just had to see her husband's face one more time. The manager of the funeral home was sympathetic and opened the coffin for her to get one last glimpse. What she saw, however, horrified her; for in place of her husband's face there was an ugly swollen foot sticking out of the top of the coffin. Naturally this created a great scandal and damaged the reputation of the mortuary. When the manager pulled the engineer into the office to talk to him he shouted ""Tell me why I shouldn't fire you right now!"" The man replied, ""it won't happen again! I've learned my lesson, honestly!"" ""And what lesson is that?"" the manager asked. ""Never put all your legs in one casket.""",0.0000514265,0.0001292503

""Well Dr, if we are but a small speck in the grand canvas of this universe, logic would dictate that somewhere out in the infinite unknown of this beautiful existence, there must be life out there as well.

6245,16,Series of Cheesy Jungle Jokes,"I always like to tell these in a series. I also like to milk jokes (drag them out a little longer than you would expect) so prepare for the cheese. There's a little flexibility in how you tell these jokes, and if you have any other jokes about jungle animals you can mix them in, but some of the order is very important (especially the first and las jokes). Here is my preferred order: Q. How do you put an elephant in the refrigerator? A. Open the door, put the elephant in, and close the door. Q. How do you put a tiger in the refrigerator? A. Open the door, take the elephant out, put the tiger in, and close the door. Q. Why did the monkey fall out of the tree? A. It was dead. Q. Why did a second monkey fall out of the tree? A. It was stapled to the first monkey. Q. Why did a third monkey fall out of the tree? A. It was taped to the second monkey. Q. Why did ANOTHER monkey fall out of the tree? A. Peer pressure. Q. What do an apple and an elephant have in common? A. They're both red... except for the elephant. (I like to say the first part, then wait a beat before the second part) Q. What's the difference between an elephant and a plum? A. Their color! Q. What did Tarzan say when he saw the elephants coming through the jungle? A. Look! Here come the elephants! Q. What did Jane say when she saw the elephants coming through the jungle? A. Look! Here come the plums. ... She's colorblind! Q. There's a big meeting in the jungle and all the animals come, except for one. Which one and why? A. The tiger! You left him in the refrigerator! One last note - you can mix it up if people guess an answer that's a little too close. So for the monkey joke, if somebody guesses tape or something stupid after the stapler comment, go deadpan and say ""No, peer pressure."" Just one example.

6288,16,The Poor Snake Named Nate," So... Nate the Snake was the king of the jungle, by virtue of his immense size. Nate was the size of a freight train, and had a similar outlook on life. He ruled largely through terror and intimidation. One day Nate the Snake was rumbling through the jungle, as was his own. Whenever Nate slithered, the earth shook, trees fell, and birds plummeted from the sky. Nate was out surveying his domain, and took a spin though the local village. Now, normally when Nate visited the village, everyone hid from him, in stark, abject, raving terror. A sort of ""hide the women and children, bury the silver in the backyard"" sort of terror. And today was no different: as Nate the Snake rolled through town, no one was on the streets, and the village seemed abandoned. Except for one man. At the far end of town, a man was standing next to a tree. Nate the Snake was bemused by this, as -- as has been mentioned -- people normally hid from him -- or at least ran screaming. But this man stood his ground. This piqued Nate's curiosity, so he rumbled and slithered up to the man. and Asked him ""Why aren't you hiding? Aren't you afraid of me?"" ""Of course I'm afraid of you, but my job is more important."" ""Oh?"" said Nate ""And what's your job?"" ""I'm the lever man. I guard the lever tree."" ""The lever tree?"" ""You see this lever here, in the side of the tree? If anyone flips this lever, it will destroy the entire world. My job is to keep an eye on the lever, and make sure no one touches it."" ""Doesn't that get awfully boring?"" ""Yes, yes it does... it's been years since I've seen my family."" Never let it be said that Nate the Snake did not have a soft side. He took pity on the man and offered to keep an eye on the lever for him, so he could take a few days off and visit his family. The man gratefully ran screaming away in terror. And life returned to normal. Eventually Nate the Snake, who was a somewhat ADD snake, got bored and decided to cruise around the jungle some more. He figured that the word was pretty well out that the lever tree was being guarded by Nate the Snake, and he decided that it was quite unlikely that anyone would mess with the lever in his absence. A little while later, Nate heard a rumbling. Thinking it might be his tail end, he stopped. Once his entire body had stopped, he still heard the rumbling. And then he panicked: what if the rumbling had something to do with the lever tree? So, Nate the Snake rumbled and slithered his way back to the village as fast as he could. As he came over the rise, he saw what was making the rumbling noise: a gigantic steamroller. The local highway department was improving the road, bunging an 8 lane mega-highway through the middle of the village. The huge steamroller was headed right for the lever tree. Nate bellowed for the driver to stop, but the driver couldn't hear him over the rumble of the steamroller. Nate rushed towards the man, trying to get his attention, but the man was focused on the steamroller. Finally, in a fit of desperation, Nate the Snake through himself in front of the steamroller. This got the driver's attention: he felt a bump big enough to notice. He stopped the steamroller to get down and take a look at what he had hit. When he got down, he saw that he had run over Nate the Snake and squashed him flat. As he started to panic, he looked around and saw that his steamroller was bare inches from the lever tree. The steamroller driver breathed a sigh of relief and exclaimed, ""Better Nate than lever."" *Budump bum.* ",0.0031185406,0.0041880151

And all of you son of a bitches who want to get off the train, get off the train. And all of you son of a bitches who want to change seats, change seats now 'cause the train's getting ready to leave. Whoo whooooo."" The mother was just devastated, so she scolded her son and said to him, ""Now son, I want to go upstairs and take your nap, and when you get up, you can't play with your train set for two hours."" So the boy took his nap and didn't even mention his train set for two hours. After the two hours were up, the boy asked his mom if he could play with his train set again. She said yes, and asked him if he understood why he was punished. He nodded his head yes, and off he went. The mother stood by door to listen to what her son would say. The boy sat down to his train set and calmly said, ""Whoo whoooooo. All of you ladies and gentlemen who want to get on the train, get on the train. All of you ladies and gentlemen who want to get off the train, get off the train. And all you son of a bitches who are pissed 'cause the train is two hours late, go talk to the bitch in the kitchen.

6387,16,There is a store in Spain that sells exquisite handmade writing instruments.,"This store has all kinds of bespoke fountain pens and rollerball pens and even ball point pens. There are pens made of fine hard woods and precious metals inlaid with all kinds of gems. These pens are all handmade by artisans who have been in the business for generations. But what really sets this shop apart is their ink master. Most people buy pens with black ink or blue ink or even red ink, mostly because they do not know the world of colors of ink available at this shop. These fine inks are carefully blended by this ink master, a prodigy among those with a sense for color. There are colors so deep you feel you could fall into them, so vibrant you'd think they were alive, and so bright you'd think they were on fire. Every color imaginable and some you can't even imagine are available here. However the ink master is rarely at the store, he travels the world sourcing ingredients for his magnificent inks. Velvet Red ink made from the shell of a Japanese beetle. Royal blue ink made from the petals of an African flower that only blooms once every four years. Making sure these ingredients are available for his customers keeps this whiz of ink away for months sometimes years at a time. But while people come from all over the world to buy this artisan ink maker's products, very few ever actually think they'll get a chance to meet him. Because nobody expects the Spanish ink whiz is in. ",0.0000374183,0.0000761055

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, But as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, A dead duck."" The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman. The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!""

6443,15,IT REALLY BREAKS MY HEART....," This event earlier this day reminds me of the man who was driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man sa,ys, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.

6444,15,The Mailman,"Courtesy of my science teacher who gives us a joke every day before class. A kid, about 5 or 6 years old, woke up one night at 4 in the morning screaming. His mother rushed into the room to see what was wrong. He told her he dreamed that their cat died. The mother assured him the cat was fine and they both went back to sleep. At about two o'clock in the afternoon the next day, the mother went outside to find their cat, which wasn't that old, dead. The next early morning, the kid woke up screaming again, and the mother rushed in. He informed her he dreamed that their grandma died. Almost like clockwork, the mother got a call at two o'clock that their grandma had a heart attack. She didn't make it over in time to say goodbye. Once again, at 4 in the morning the kid woke up screaming. Same scenario, except this time the kid said, ""I had a dream daddy died."" At this point, the parents are scared, so they hatch a plan to make sure the dad didn't die. The next morning, the dad got up, ate breakfast, and went to work, being very careful and scared on the road. He made it to his office, and locked himself in. He waited a until midnight before coming home, exhausted but alive. They were both happy, but the dad asked, ""did anything happened while I was gone?"" The mother said, ""Yeah, didn't you hear? The mailman was delivering and got run over by a truck and died!"" ",0.0000530482,0.0001775803

6448,15,Young King Arthur,"Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom. The monarch could have killed him but was moved by Arthur's youth and ideals. So, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer and, if after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death. The question?....What do women really want? Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query. But, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end. He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester. He spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. Many people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer. But the price would be high; as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged. The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first . The old witch wanted to marry Sir Lancelot, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend! Young Arthur was horrified. She was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc. He had never encountered such a repugnant creature in all his life. He refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such a terrible burden; but Lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He said nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table. Hence, a wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered Arthur's question thus: What a woman really wants, she answered....is to be in charge of her own life. Everyone in the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. And so it was, the neighboring monarch granted Arthur his freedom and Lancelot and the witch had a wonderful wedding. The honeymoon hour approached and Lancelot, steeling himself for a horrific experience, entered the bedroom. But, what a sight awaited him. The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him on the bed. The astounded Lancelot asked what had happened . The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as a witch, she would henceforth, be her horrible deformed self only half the time and the beautiful maiden the other half. Which would he prefer? Beautiful during the day....or night? Lancelot pondered the predicament. During the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch ? Or, would he prefer having a hideous witch during the day, but by night, a beautiful woman for him to enjoy wondrous intimate moments? What would YOU do? What Lancelot chose is below. BUT.....make YOUR choice before you scroll down below. OKAY? Noble Lancelot said that he would allow HER to make the choice herself. Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life. Now...what is the moral to this story? <Scroll Down> The moral is: If you don't let a woman have her own way, things are going to get ugly... ",0.0000641019,0.0074380576

One day, a giant appeared on the hilltops surrounding Trid. Every time a trade caravan would leave, the giant would kick them back down the hill. Over the days, the Trids began to grow afraid that they would starve without their bustling trade economy, so they held a town meeting to figure out what to do about the giant. They decided to try and reason with him before they would fight him, and that the wisest among them should go out the following day. Unanimously, they elected the town Rabbi as the wisest man. So the next day, the Rabbi went out to speak to the giant. He got kicked back down the hills before he could even say a word. He went up a second time with the same result. Although battered and bruised, he tried one last time. Before the giant could kick him he yelled out, ""Stop!"" And the giant actually stopped. ""What is it?"" the giant asked. ""I'm the local Rabbi and I represent the Trids"" the Rabbi replied. ""We want to you to stop kicking us down the hills or we'll starve. Will you stop kicking us?""

The artist accepts the deal with one condition. No one can see the piece before it is completed.

The artist goes so far as to hire a security firm who have signed non disclosure agreements. After 4 months of work, the mural is complete. A massive unveiling is planned. The local media, the high school band, the entire town, and the state governor are all in attendance. With much fanfair, the curtain is dropped. The 60 foot wide by 20 foot tall mural is revealed. The mural depicts a beautiful scene of the American Southwest, filled with brilliant colors and amazing details. There are hundreds of Native Americans in amazingly accurate period correct clothing from the late 1800's. Everyone is in awe... Until they start looking a little closer. Many of the the Native Americans are in various stages of undress. They are all engaged in coitus in every position and combination imaginable. All in photograph- quality detail. But it gets worse. Interspersed throughout the scene of debauchery, there are enormous piles of feces. Fly-ridden and festering in the sun. After a moment of focusing on it, you could swear you could smell it. The piles of waste have beams of golden light descending from the heavens onto them. Some of the piles even have halos above them. Everyone is now silent, mouths agape at what they're seeing. Finally, the governor bellows out, ""What have you done here? This is disgusting! Explain yourself!"" The artist calmly replied, ""I did exactly what was asked of me. I have painted a piece of art depicting an important moment in American history. This represents the last words uttered by General George Custer at the battle of Litttle Big Horn."" Holy shit.

The sherrif responds: ""Give him a ticket, he can't be more important than me, the sherrif."" To which the officer responds: ""I think he might be more important than you, sir"". ""So, is he more important than the Chief of Police?"" ""Yes sir."" the officer confirms. ""More important than the President of the united states?!"" Hesitant the officer replies: ""He might be!""

The two fell silent for a moment before the first man continued. ""I tell you man, Sharon is great, but I get the feeling she's seeing another man."" ""Really? What gives you that idea?"" ""The only time I get to see her is at night. She claims she works in the mornings and leaves before I wake up, almost always dressed nice, and when she comes back she smells strongly of men's cologne."" The brother pondered for a moment. ""That's odd. It sounds a lot like my situation, except reversed. This girl I met recently, Karen, is only available really early in the mornings, and claims she has to care for her mother at night. She even looks exactly like the woman you described."" The two stopped walking and thought for a moment before coming to a shocking realization. The rest of the walk home was silent, with awkwardness hanging in the air. Upon arriving home, the two got a cup of coffee and stayed up all night talking out the situation. It took hours; but the two came to came to a solution where neither had to break up with the girl. They decided that Sharon is Karen.",0.0000436390,0.0000642301

6660,14,There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath.,"After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals. Many years passed by like that. At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard. With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said: Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked: Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off. A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said: Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked: Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man: Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon. Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man: Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger: Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard. Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked: Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time. Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked: But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked: Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it? All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.

It was a fairly large operation, as it had to be, and a few low life kids would always be brought on to do odd jobs. One was this baby face type of fellow, Ralph Spenson. The locals just called in Lil Ace cause' you could trust him to slip you a card if need be. Kid came from the gutters. Dad left early, mom was a former junkie. Not good stock. So of course the kid finds his way into this hell hole, and the visitors come to like to him. Kids seems a bit innocent in nature at first, but he develops a reputation as a bit of a cheat, but he's always forgiven an all on amount of his boyish disposition. Over time, he climes the ranks and becomes one of the low level bookies. The boys growing up to be a real snake of a man, but whata you expect with his background. So the world turns and the dice rolls. One day, though, it's as if all of hell freezes over, cause the law comes walking through the door and a shoot erupts. 4 of our men our wounded, 1 cop is down. Horrible type of thing. No one knows how the feds found out. I mean, of course we know it's some rat, but we don't know who the brain dead sucker is. Men are sneaking out the back, police is swarming the place, the Big Honcho is in handcuffs. Fantasy I tells you. Pure and utter disbelief. This type of betrayal doesn't happen in our world. Not like this. Then the bookie kid, Lil Ace, walks toward the police, and they shake his hands. Damn kid was an informant. He fit in with the crowd here so well, but he went straight on us.

So back in antiquity, I'm talking about like between the 14th century up until the 20th century whenever scholars would talk about the world they would frame it with the slogan, ""The Occident vs The Orient"". Now the Occident was all of Western Europe whereas the Orient was all the land stretching as far west as the Mediterranean to as Far East as the Atlantic (I.e.) most of the (known) world; just for a better understanding in contemporary terms when I say ""Occident vs Orient"" think of how today people talk about ""the clash of civilizations"". Anywho what I thought would be funny is instead of calling white folks crackers (which just entails someone who owned people and land) orientals and persons of colour should refer to whites as accidents and whenever we see a hetro white couple leaving a pub or a party together we can say things like ""oh that's just an accident waiting to happen.""",0.7699279189,0.0022673232

""There simply aren't enough percussionists to cover all of these parts. No one can get to it in time."" Frustrated, the director walks out of the hall and finds a homeless man. He offers the man some money in return for playing this one cymbal crash at the end of the concert. The homeless man agrees and follows the director back into the hall. They run the tune one more time, and the homeless man does great! Satisfied, the director lets everyone go home for the night. On the night of the concert, the director is anxiously directing his orchestra, and he gives the cue for the big cymbal crash at the end. The homeless man misses it. The director, who is now furious, rages through the orchestra and kills the man. The police come and take the director to prison, and he is sentenced to death. On his final night in prison, the guard asks the man what he wants as his last meal. He replies, ""I would love 10,000 pounds of bananas."" The guard, though puzzled, complies and brings him 10,000 pounds of bananas. On the day of his execution, the man is lead to the electric chair. After the first shock, he does not die. After the second shock, he still doesn't die. After the third shock, he still doesn't die! So the guards release him. The guard, puzzled by this asks the man if he knew something they didn't about having so many bananas in your system.

7169,12,A drunk man borrows and loses his partner's prosthetic leg in a game of roulette in Las Vegas while she's asleep in their room. When she wakes up in the morning she is furious and sends him down to the tables to win it back...,"..the man, now sober, is absolutely determined to make up for his sordid late night misdeed, and immediately challenges the casino to win back the prosthetic leg. For the whole next day he is at the table, losing pile after pile of chips, thousands and thousands of dollars at a time. Soon, a small crowd is gathered round him, watching, as this intense game goes on and on. One observer taps the man on the shoulder and he turns irritably. ""How long are you going to do this?"" The observer asks. ""As long as it takes to win back this leg."" The man responds shortly. Pausing only to relieve himself in a bucket provided by the casino, the man continues to play for the leg through the night and into the next day. Money seems to be no issue for him, he never sleeps and he never seems to tire either. Now a huge crowd is gathered around him as he reaches the end of his first week trying to win back the leg. No-one can believe how much this man wants to make up for his transgression. People begin to praise the man on social media. The casino manager makes his way through the crowd on the floor to approach the man, who does not take lightly to being interrupted in his so far frivolous pursuit. ""How long are you going to do this?"" The manager asks. ""As long as it takes to win back this leg."" The man responds, barely looking away from the table. A month passes and still sadly unsuccessful, the man does not waiver in his efforts to win back the leg. Now the casino is the biggest attraction in Las Vegas. People pay just to watch the man relentlessly and seemingly without fatigue play over and over again, despite the overwhelming bad-luck he is experiencing. The man's mother is cleared to approach the man. ""How long are you going to do this?"" His mother asks. ""As long as it takes to win back this leg!"" The man responds, barely looking away from the table. Six months pass and the man is STILL at the table, he is being fed through a tube and has a catheter installed along with an adult diaper, so now even his ablutions do not hamper his attempts to win back the leg. A TV crew finally breaks through the crowd which by now stretches out the edges of the Las Vegas strip. The reporter excitedly gets a microphone into the man's face. ""How long are you going to do this?"" The reporter asks. ""Look I've told you!"" The man roars. ""I'm going to do this for the rest of my wife!""",0.0005535297,0.0002106782

The wizard closes his eyes breathing in deeply, holding his breath, then releasing. *Click clack click clack click* The bones scatter across the table and the wizard begins to decipher the man's fortune.

7346,11,Sheep Shagging,"An old Oxford professor is nearing retirement and decides that he wants to do something fun for once. He's spent his whole life researching scientific theories in his lab and wants to do something outside for a change, so he asks his assistant for a suggestion of something different to go and research. This assistant is a bit of a git and decides he'll play a prank on the old man, and suggests he research 'sheep shagging'. The professor thinks this is a great idea and heads off to Wales to begin his research.He heads out to the countryside and finds a farmer to quiz about his unnatural habits. The professor greets him and asks if he's got time to answer a couple of quick questions. ""No problem boyo"" says the farmer, ""go right ahead. ""Well,"" said the professor, ""what I'd like to know first is, do you own any sheep here?"" ""Of course boyo, biggest farm for miles round here I have. We've got loads of 'em"" ""Great, now the next question is a bit personal - do you use your sheep for sex?"" ""Ohh, too right boyo. There's three or four out there who are my particular favourites."" ""So, how exactly do you... do it?"" ""Well, normally I take them down to the river, I slap their back feet in my wellies, the sheep pushes back from the water, bloody heaven boyo."" The professor thanks him and heads for the airport. Having heard about the Kiwis, he heads out to New Zealand with exactly the same plan. He finds a farm, talks to the farmer and gets the same responses. ""Round up the sheep, head 'em up towards a cliff and off you go. Back feet in my boots, sheep pushing back from the cliff, bloody marvelous mate."" Again, the professor thanks him and decides that his research needs only one more addition. So he jets off to the world centre of sheep shagging, Australia. Once in Australia, he drives out to the bush, finds the biggest farm he can and knocks on the farmhouse door. He repeats his questions to the farmer. ""Too right mate. Usually I stick their back legs in me wellies, front legs over me shoulders and away we go!"" ""So the sheep faces you? That's strange - I've been talking to people around the world about this, and they all do it with the sheep facing away from them."" The Aussie is shocked. For a few seconds he can't speak, then he manages to stutter, ""What? No kissing?""",0.0041755447,0.0250104126

7377,11,"Drums good. Drums stop, bad."," A rich businessman is reading the newspaper one day, and stumbles across an article about North Sentinel Island and the indigenous people there who are virtually untouched by modern civilization. He decides on the spot, that he must see them for himself, however it is illegal to travel there. No matter, he has his assistant do some research, and sure enough there is an illegal charter he can take to the island, with a tour guide who promises to bring him to see the Sentinelese for the right price. He lines up the trip, and the next month he and his tour guide make land on North Sentinel Island under the cover of night. The first thing he notices is that off in the distance the sound of drums fills the night air. Intrigued and excited to be one of the few people in the world to have heard such drumming, he asks, ""What are the drums we are hearing? Is it some kind of ceremony?"" The tour guide, looking startled turns around as says, ""Drums good. Drums stop, bad."" and continues into the jungle. They travel inland for miles, the drums getting louder and louder all the time, and finally as the sun is beginning to set - stop to make camp. At this point, the drumming has gone on non-stop for 12 hours and is loud enough that they need to raise their voices to communicate. The businessman, getting annoyed, says to his guide, ""This is getting ridiculous! Do they ever stop that blasted drumming?!"" The tour guide, looks at the businessman with a serious expression and again says, ""Drums good. Drums stop, bad."" The businessman does his best to sleep through the noise, but his head is splitting from a headache and he is barely able to get any rest. They pack up their things in the morning and head off, again deeper into the jungle - the noise from the drumming getting louder and louder with every step. Finally, the businessman can take it no more. He reaches forward and grabs his guide by the shoulder and spins him around. Screaming to be heard over the drums, he asks, ""What is with these god damn drums? Don't tell me 'Drums good. Drums stop, bad.' again! I want to know what happens if the god damn drums stop!"" The guide, pauses and looks at him with fear in his eyes. ""Drums stop, bass solo.""",0.0002838057,0.8664636612

Also the original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me that I could have free beer during the tasting. So I accepted. Here are the scorecards from the event: CHILI # 1: MIKE'S MANIC MONSTER CHILI JUDGE ONE: A little to heavy on tomato. Amusing kick. JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavour. Very mild. FRANK: Holy Shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with this stuff. I needed two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. Those Texans are crazy. CHILI # 2: ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI JUDGE ONE: Smokey, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang. JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavour. Needs more peppers to be taken seriously. FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave of two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich manoeuvre. They had to walkie-talkie in three extra beers when they saw the look on my face. CHILI # 3: FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans. JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili. A bit salty. Good use of red peppers. FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced. CHILI # 4: BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC JUDGE ONE: Black Bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing. JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods. Not much of a chili. FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating. CHILI # 5: LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive. JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no linger focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly from a pitcher onto it. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Freakin' Rednecks! ! ! CHILI # 6: VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers. JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions and garlic. FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulphuric flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone! CHILI # 7: SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers. JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum. Tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge # 3. FRANK: You could puta Grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit, to match my shirt. At least the during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the four inch hole in my stomach. CHILI # 8: HELEN'S MOUNT SAINT CHILI JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending. This is a nice blend chili, safe for all; not too bold, but spicy enough to declare its existence. JUDGE TWO: This final entry isa good balanced chili, neither mild now hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge # 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank. FRANK: - - - - - Mama?- - - (Editor's Note: Judge # 3 was unable to report).",0.0000637968,0.1275260299

This happened several times a week, and sometimes twice on Sundays. The priest said, 'That was a long time ago and by doing what you did, you placed the two of you in great danger. but two people under those circumstances can easily succumb to the weakness of the flesh. However, if you are truly sorry for your actions, you are indeed forgiven.' 'Thank you, Father. That's a great load off my mind. I do have one more question.' 'And what is that?' asked the priest.

He was astonished to see that his bed was nicely made and everything was picked up off the floor. Then he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow that was addressed to 'Dad.' Fearing the worst, he opened the envelope with trembling hands and read the letter. It said: *Dear Dad,* *It is with great regret and sadness that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.* *I have been finding real passion with Susie and she is so nice. But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am.* *But it's not only the passion. Dad she's pregnant.* *Don't worry though, Susie said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.* *Susie has also opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.* *In the meantime, we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Susie can get better. She deserves it.* *Don't worry Dad. I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.* *Someday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that you can get to know your grandchildren.* *Love, Your son Tim.* *P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jimmy's house.* *I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than a lousy report card ...* *That's in my desk drawer.* *I love you.*",0.0000381532,0.0001646514

Right after he picked her up, he felt the need to fart, but he figured he could wait until they got to the movies. When they got there, he asked her if she wanted some popcorn and Coke. She said sure, so he went to the restroom. The line was long, so he went back to the lobby, got the food, and went back into the theatre. When the movie was over, he goes to the bathroom again, still with a tremondously long line. So he figures he can wait until he drops her off. When they pull up into her driveway, she exclaims, ''Oh goodie. My grandparents are here. Come on in and meet them.'' He agrees, although his A-hole is about to cry at this point. They go in and sit down at the table. Finally, he couldn't hold it in any longer a tried to let it seep out a little at a time. As he squeezed out a toxic blast, he aimed it towards the family's hound dog Duke, in hopes that they might blame the pooch for the horrendous fart. The girl's father stands up and hollers ''Duke!!'' and sits back down. ''Great!'' he thought. ''They really think it's the dog!'' So, he starts bombarding the room with a couple, more powerful, louder stinkers. Once again, the girl's father stands up, shouts ''Duke!!'' and sits back down. Finally, he lets it all go and the loudest most hair-curling fart you've ever heard or smelt rippled through the dining room. The girl's father stands up again.

7685,10,3 Friends decided to go hunting together,"Later, as the day darkens, they lay down their tents and settle down around a fire. After eating and chatting for a while, one of the hunters gets tired, and goes to sleep. Half an hour later, one of the two awake hunters gets an idea. ""You know what would be really funny? We still have one rabbit left over..."" he says. ""We could cut it open and put its intestines in Mike's pants, so when he wakes up, he's going to think he's shat his ass out"" he continues, referring to their sleeping friend. The other hunter is very amused about the idea, and so they execute their plan, putting rabbit intestines in their sleeping friend's pants. As the morning dawns, the two pranksters meet each other outside their tents. Both grinning far and wide, they decide to check on their friend. However, the man is not in his tent! Fortunately, they soon notice their friend coming from the woods, waving a stick. ""Hey guys!"" he shouts. ""You'll never guess what happened to me! I had shat my ass out during the night."" The two hunters are trying their hardest not to burst into laughter. ""But it's ok! I shoved it back with a stick.""",0.0000418746,0.1226647273

The bear says to himself, ""If that fly drops three inches, that fish will jump and catch the fly, and I'll snatch the fish, and have myself a nice meal."" And on the hill near the river is a hunter eating a sandwich, who sees the bear, the fish, and the fly. The hunter says to himself, ""If that fly drops three inches, that fish will jump and catch the fly, that bear will snatch the fish, and I'll shoot the bear, and have myself a nice meal."" And at the bottom of that hill lies a mouse, who sees the hunter, his sandwich, the bear, the fish, and the fly. The mouse says to himself, ""If that fly drops three inches, that fish will jump and catch the fly, that bear will snatch the fish, that hunter will shoot the bear, and drop his sandwich, and I'll get it, and have myself a nice meal."" And in a tree on the bank of the river is a cat, who sees the mouse, the hunter, his sandwich, the bear, the fish, and the fly. The cat says to himself, ""If that fly drops three inches, that fish will jump and catch the fly, that bear will snatch the fish, that hunter will shoot the bear, and drop his sandwich, that mouse will get the sandwich, and I'll pounce on the mouse, and have myself a nice meal."" Then, it happens. The fly flew lower, the fish caught the fly, the bear snatched the fish, the hunter shot the bear, and dropped his sandwich, the mouse got it, and the cat jumped out of the tree.

The minister gave a lesson entitled, 'If you could bring a suitcase to heaven'. The old man misunderstands the lesson, however, and actually believes that he is allowed to bring one suitcase to heaven with him upon his death. The next day, he liquidates some assets and buys a few gold bars to put in a suitcase. He figures, 'I don't know what currency they use in heaven, but surely gold is a good standard for anywhere.' That night, the old man dies in his sleep and, miraculously, his suitcase of gold bars is with him! An angel meets him at the pearly gates to show him around. First, he takes him to his new heavenly mansion to help him unpack before the rest of the tour. They get inside, open the suitcase, and suddenly, the angel gets a quizzical look.

They advise park visitors to wear little bells on their clothes so they make noise when hiking. The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge. Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away. It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat. Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper.",0.0000440501,0.0000761579

7915,10,I run an Antiques shop with my wife,"One day, as I'm in the middle of haggling with an elderly customer over a cracked 18th century vase, my wife runs in, flustered, and exclaims: ""Quick! Come outside and see what these bastards are doing!"". Confused, I apologise to the patron and follow her outside to see a group of workmen in the process of completing a sign above the shop adjacent to my own reading: ""Best Antiques in Town"" Grumbling to myself, I tell my wife to finish her errands and reluctantly continue my day. After a week of seeing customers walk past my shop and into the neighbouring one, I decide that enough is enough and storm into their shop to demand they take their sign down. With a shit-eating grin, the shop owner tells me his antiques really are the best in town, and that my wife and I should suck it up or find another town to sell in. The next day, after locking up my shop, I see another group of workmen setting up a sign above the shop on the other side to my own. Furious, I return home and tell my wife what I saw: ""and you'll never guess what it says"", I told her: ""Cheapest Antiques in Town"" ""How many bloody antique sellers are there in this town!?"" she exclaimed, ""they're going to put us out of business!"" she cried, visibly upset. After another week of losing customers to the shops on either side, I figure it's worth a try to see if they'll take their sign down. The second shop owner, with the same shit-eating grin, tells me: ""You're as old as the antiques you sell, it's time to make room for the young sellers"" and tells me to leave. After coming home to my distraught wife I tell her that I've had an idea to fix the situation. After making a few phone calls I head to bed with a smile on my face. The next week, my shop is bustling with people and as I'm in the middle of haggling with another elderly customer over a broken piece of Elizabethan jewellery, a workman interrupts me and tells me that he's finished. Apologising to the patron, I step outside and look up at my new sign. A shit-eating grin appears on my face as I read it: ""Entrance"" ",0.0000421684,0.8770160675

The girl says yes, and the boy is over the moon. He's got to get everything ready first though. He needs a tux, to rent a limo, and to get her a corsage. The prom isn't far away, so the boy starts working on getting everything ready. First he goes out to rent a tux, and when he gets there, there's a line at the tux shop. So he stands in the tux line, and finally gets up there to pick out the perfect tux. Next, a limo. So, he heads to the limo rental place in town, when he gets there, there's another line. So he stands in the limo line, and finally gets up there to rent a limo. All that's left is to get her a corsage, so he heads to the florist. When he gets there... wouldn't you know it, another line. So the boy stands in the florist line... finally he gets up to pick out the perfect corsage. The big day finally arrives, and the boy gets ready. He's got his tux on, the corsage ready to go, and the limo standing by to pick them up. So, he goes to her place to pick her up, and she is stunningly beautiful. She loves the corsage, and can't wait to go to the prom. They ride off in the limo, talking and laughing on the way. They finally arrive at the prom, and ... can you believe it? There's a line to get in the prom. So they stand in the prom line, talking with their friends, having fun. They finally make it in, and the music is going, the lights are flashing, and they start dancing and having a blast.

8045,9,[Long] This wealthy couple from New York made a trip down south...,"To visit some relatives that retired down in Florida. They were big foodies and decided to make a stop in Tennessee because they had never had good southern food but had heard how good it was. They find a hole in the wall southern food joint and pulled their new Range Rover in between two old beat up trucks. The restaurant wasn't really full yet because it was just before 11am but they were hungry from the long drive. Their were only 2 middle aged men sitting at a table in the corner of the room. They were wearing overalls that were dirty and they probably had 10 teeth between the both of them. Excited to try the food, the young rich couple got a little of everything but was most excited to try the fried chicken. While the wife is taking a picture of her food, her husband begins to choke on a chicken bone. The wife freaks out and starts screaming for someone to help. The two hillbillies in the corner calmly stand up, walk over to the couple and one man unbuckles is overalls, pulls them down and bends over the table next to the couple. The other hillbilly gets on his knees and starts licking the other hillbilly's asshole. All of a sudden the husband begins to gag as he sees a man licking another man's asshole. The husband then throws up from being completely grossed out and along with it the chicken bone, saving his life. The two hillbillies stand up and as they are walking back to their lunch, the 1st hillbilly says "" See there Jim Bo, I told ya that there hind lick maneuver would work""",0.0000367847,0.9413072467

The nun agrees and they turn off the lights to sleep. Halfway through the night, the nun who has always had the hots for the priests gets frisky and suddenly has an idea. ""Father, it's very cold. Could you help me...? I'm sure God will understand..."" Hearing this, the priest gets up from the floor, gets a blanket and gives it to her. Irritated but determined to succeed, she tries again after a few minutes. ""Father, I'm still cold! Could you *please* help me...? I'm sure God will understand..."" So the priest gets up, gets a blanket and gives it to her and lies down again on the floor. By now the nun is mad enough that she throws caution to the wind. She sits up in bed and puts on a seductive pose, before saying: ""Father! It's still cold, and no amount of blankets will help! Just for tonight, why don't you treat me as if I were your wife...? I'm sure God will understand..."" The priest slowly sits up from where he lies, breathing deeply as he considers this heavy decision. ""Treat you like a husband would his wife, you say...?""

8221,9,The Bee Joke,"Once, there was a bee who lived in a very complex bee hive. All the bees residing in this hive lived very happily with their own tasks and aspirations. However, this particular bee, named Bart, was quite special. He was an incredibly intelligent bee who matured and learned far faster than his bee peers. Even after his parents send him to bee high school at the age of 10, Bart the bee outperformed every one of his classmates. One day, his teacher invites his parents to class for a meeting. In this meeting, the teacher suggested that Bart be sent to a human high school. While at first skeptical, they decide that this would be the best opportunity for their son. They send Bart to a human high school, where surprisingly enough, he flourishes even more as a student. At the age of 16, Bart the bee graduated as a valedictorian at this human high school. When it came to furthering his education, he applied and was accepted to all the major ivy league universities across the country; Yale, Princeton, Harvard, you name it. He ultimately settled on MIT, where he studied as an honor roll student and became a Political Science major. After graduating at the age of 20, he used his knowledge to pursue politics, first running for the mayor of Boston, near MIT. Much to a shock of just about everyone, Bart the bee was elected almost unanimously, proceeding to become the most liked mayor of all time. Furthering his political career, he ran for the governor of Massachusetts, once again being unanimously elected with unprecedented approval levels. Bart the bee became the Governor of Massachusetts. To top it all off, Bart the bee decided that he would run for president of the United States. This, obviously, has never been attempted in the history of, well, ever. However, Bart had become so universally adored by nearly all of humanity, that there virtually no opposition to Bart's campaign. By default, Bart the bee became the POTUS. Having accomplished just about everything he could have possibly accomplished in his bee life, he looked back on his life and came to the realization that none of what he achieved would have been possible had his parents taken the leap of faith on his behalf. Thusly, he decided he would return to his home hive and spend some time with his parents. When Bart returned to the hive, he was welcomed as a celebrity, being loved by humans and bees alike. His parents were absolutely overjoyed to see their bee son once again. He decided that he would treat them to a delicious steak dinner at his favorite restaurant. After a bit of a flight, he arrives at the restaurant and finds that the wait time is over an hour long. Not wanting to abuse his status as president to obtain a table, he decides to take his parents to the pub for a drink. However, upon arriving at this pub, he realizes that the queue line is out the door and all the way down the block. Frustrated, he decides that he will simply take his parents for a nice glass of fruit punch.

The Japanese won by a mile. Afterward, the American team was discouraged by the loss. Morale sagged. Corporate management decided that the reason for the crushing defeat had to be found, so a consulting firm was hired to investigate the problem and recommended corrective action. The consultant's finding: The Japanese team had eight people rowing and one person steering; the American team had one person rowing and eight people steering. After a year of study and millions spent analyzing the problem, the consultant firm concluded that too many people were steering and not enough were rowing on the American team. So as race day neared again the following year, the American team's management structure was completely reorganized. The new structure: four steering managers, three area steering managers and a new performance review system for the person rowing the boat to provide work incentive. The next year, the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the American corporation laid off the rower for poor performance and gave the managers a bonus for discovering the problem.

The two women were standing there, staring at the picture, scratching their heads and trying to figure this out. The artist walked by and noticed the women's confusion. ""Can I help you with this painting?"" he asked. ""Well, yes"" said the one woman. ""We were curious about the picture of the black men on the bench.

8327,8,the Ogre and the Trids,"Once upon a time long, long ago there were beings called Trids barely making a living on the side of a hill. They knew, however, that there was a beautiful field of valuable Flurd just on the other side of the hill, and if they could get their hands on some of that Flurd, their lives would improve immeasurably. Unfortunately, there was a large, foul-tempered Ogre who lived on the top of the hill and guarded that Flurd night and day. The Trids tried everything to get over the hill to the fields of Flurd. They charged up the hill in great numbers. Didn't matter; the disgusting Ogre kicked them all back down the hill. They attempted to sneak past the Ogre at night. Didn't matter; the despicable Ogre kicked them all back down the hill. They attempted a flanking maneuver; some Trids running to the left of the Ogre and others to the right. Didn't matter; the revolting Ogre kicked them all back down the hill. No matter what they tried, the damned Ogre kicked the Trids back down the hill. One day, as the Trids were moping around at the base of their hill, a small rabbit happened upon them. ""Why so sad, Trids?"" asked the rabbit. The Trids sadly told the rabbit about the beautiful Flurd on the other side of the hill, and how the terrible Ogre kicked them down the hill no matter how hard they tried to get to the other side. ""How about I try?"" said the rabbit. ""Go ahead,"" said the Trids miserably. ""But I don't think you'll have any luck."" So the rabbit hopped up the hill, approaching the Ogre. The Ogre ignored him. The rabbit hopped right alongside the Ogre. Still no reaction from the Ogre. The rabbit hopped right past the Ogre, and the Ogre did nothing! So the rabbit hopped down the hill, gathered as much Flurd as he could hold in his short rabbit arms, and hopped back up the hill. He then hopped right in front of the Ogre, holding the Flurd right in front of him. The Ogre opened one eye, sighed, and closed it again. ""Excuse me, Mr. Ogre,"" said the rabbit, ""but how is it that you let me hop right past you and take as much Flurd as I can carry, but you kick the Trids down the hill whenever they get close to you?"" And the Ogre said, ""Silly rabbit, kicks are for Trids."" &#x200B;",0.0005008584,0.8608834743

'Well,' he says, 'I figure the job will run about $900: $400 for materials, $400 for my crew and $100 profit for me.' The Tennessee contractor also does some measuring and figuring, then says, 'I can do this job for $700: $300 for materials, $300 for my crew and $100 profit for me.' The New York contractor doesn't measure or figure, but leans over to the White House official and whispers, '$2,700.' The official, incredulous, says, 'You didn't even measure like the other guys! How did you come up with such a high figure?' The New York contractor whispers back, '$1000 for me, $1000 for you, and we hire the guy from Tennessee to fix the fence.'

Later, the worker met up with the manager of the restaurant and told him about the dilemma. ""I think you might have made something a little more offensive than you intended,"" he said. ""Nonsense,"" replied the manager. ""The ad campaign has been test-run by executives, and every single one of them has given us the green light."" ""So why were there so many people complaining about the ad while I was putting it up?"" asked the worker. ""Oh, that's natural,"" the manager answered.

To show the others who is the boss, he beats it to death with a spade. Realizing his employer won't be best pleased, he disposes of the fish by feeding it to the lions, as lions will eat anything. Moving on to the second job of clearing out the chimpanzee house, he is attacked by the chimps and pelt him with coconuts. He swipes at two chimps with a spade, killing them both. What can he do? Feed them to the lions, he says to himself, because lions eat anything. He hurls the corpses into the lion enclosure. He moves on to the last job, which is to collect honey from the South American Bees. As soon as he starts he is attacked and stung by the bees. He grabs the spade and smashes the bees to a pulp. By now he knows what to do and throws them into the lion's cage - because lions eat anything. Later that day a new lion arrives at the zoo.

They couldn't get the timing right and managed to somehow fall over continuously. The day came for the marching contest. Russia and America were the 2 countries that were most likely going to win, while Spain had no hope. The first competitor was Russia. They marched perfectly, just how they did in practice. A score of 9. America was the same, but a few mistakes. A score of 8. Now came Spains turn. Then suddenly, it was as if they had been practicing for years. It was perfect, as if they were robots. Each footstep was at the exact same time as the others. Their body movement was amazing to watch. A score of 10. After the contest the American and Russian marching leaders asked the Spain leader how they did it. The Spain leader replies: ""Well, nobody expects the Spanish in position!""

8627,8,Engineers!,"Background information: In India we have long distance trains which are pulled using engines and have toilet facilities, and seats which double as beds. It issues two types of tickets one is to ride the train (used by people to travel short distances, 8-10hrs) and another is to ride the train and have a seat assigned (used for longer distances). We also have, in certain cities like Mumbai, a local train system, which is electric, has only seats (which people do sometimes use as beds) and no toilet facilities, usually running within the city or to closer by towns a short distance away, usually the entire journey is under 5hrs Onto the joke. 5 doctors and 5 engineers had to go out of the city, so they had a short 5-6 hour travel in the long distance train. The doctors had purchased a ticket each and the engineers bought 1 ticket and split the cost. The ticket collector (TC) came around to check the tickets. He clipped the tickets of each of the doctors and in the meantime all the engineers went and hid in the toilet. The TC knocked on the door, it was opened ever so slightly and the single ticket was thrust out, the TC checked it, clipped it and gave it back. On the return journey, the doctors were angry to have spent money. They decided to use the same trick as the engineers. They bought 1 ticket amongst themselves, the engineers noted this and didn't buy any tickets at all. When the TC arrived the doctors and engineers all went to hide in the toilet. The doctors were smiling thinking the engineers would be fined, when there is a knock on their door asking for a ticket. One of the doctors hands out the ticket and the engineer who asked for it takes it and goes back to the toilet they have hidden in. The real TC comes the engineers repeat the process and their ticket is clipped, while the doctors are asked to step out and are all fined. The doctors are livid. They reach the city and there is a further train they need to take to reach their work place. The doctors decide they won't but any ticket and will trick the engineers. The engineers all purchase a ticket apiece. The TC comes and the doctors smugly get up to hide in the toilet and the engineers quietly sit and have their tickets clipped. The doctors are all caught and fined again because there is no toilet in the local train.",0.0000398318,0.0000995222

8631,8,Three people die and appear before Buddha,"Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads. -Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though. One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled. -Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve. -My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution. -My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person. -I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation. The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him. -Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life? -Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables. -You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job? -Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place. -This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours? -W-well, I don't know what to tell you.

8653,8,The New Market on the Corner,"A new market opened up in Bill's neighborhood, so he decided to go down and see what they had for sale. Inside appeared to be different produce stands, but, strangely, all he saw were bakery stuffs on the shelves. One was covered in pies and labeled ""Pineapple Pies - $2/lb."" Another was covered in pastries and labeled ""Cherry Tarts - $0.85/lb."" And on and on it went: ""Banana Biscuits - $1.15/lb."" ""Lemon Loaves - $2.95/lb."" etc. etc. An attendant, who was stocking what looked like Watermelon Muffins, asked Bill, ""Finding everything okay?"" ""What is this place, exactly?"" ""It's a baked fruit stand! We sell nothing but fruit, but they only are sold baked into our wonderful doughs and pastries."" ""Wow!"" replied Bill. ""That's a cool idea! Is there anything you recommend?"" ""Absolutely! Our Orange Cookies are to die for! They're our most popular product! But, unfortunately, the farmers who reap our fruits haven't been able to grow enough oranges to keep them in stock."" Just then, a pickup truck pulled up to the shop and out came three individuals dressed in overalls and sun hats to unload crates from out the back. ""Who are they?"" ""Those are the farmers and bakers who supply our stock. They're actually native to this land, so not only are they our suppliers, but they actually own the grounds on which the market was built."" Bill looked over the crates and remarked, ""Doesn't look like they have any Orange Cookies today, either. Do they restock the same time everyday?"" ""Yes, sir,"" replied the attendant, ""every day at 8."" ""Great! Then I will see you tomorrow."" So Bill headed over to the market the next day, just as the farmers finished unloading the last crate. He noticed the empty shelf and asked the attendant, ""No Orange Cookies today?"" The attendant replied, while shaking his head, ""Nope, I'm afraid not."" Bill mumbled under his breath, ""So frustrating..."" as he walked out of the shop. The next day, Bill returned while the farmers were still unloading the day's stock. The attendant looked over at him as he asked, ""Got any Orange Cookies today?"" The attendant simply frowned and shook his head. Bill grumbled, a little louder this time, ""Useless farmers..."" Again, the next day Bill arrived in the middle of the farmers unloading their truck. He walked straight up to the attendant, who looked at him with a sad expression on his face. ""I'm sorry, sir, no Orange Cookies today, neither."" Bill began to bluster frustratedly, then turned to the farmers and yelled, ""*WHAT GOOD ARE YOU!?!*"" The attendant immediately stomped his foot and pointed his finger right in Bill's face as he said, ""Hey!

8915,7,Young v Old Drivers," Elsie, an elderly lady, stopped to drive into a parking space when a young man in his brand new red BMW drove around her and parked in the space that she had been waiting for. Elsie was so angered that she approached the young fellow and enquired, through gritted teeth, 'I was about to park there.' The man looked at her with disdain and replied, 'That's what you can do when you're young and bright.' This annoyed Elsie even more, so she got back in her car, backed it up and then she stamped on the accelerator and rammed straight into his BMW. The young man ran back to his car and shouted in a stunned voice, 'What did you do that for?' Elsie smiled at him and said, 'That's what you can do when you're old and rich.'",0.0000785930,0.0007979727

The pilot announced, ""Uh Folks, we just experienced some turbulence, which caused some engine troubles on our left wing. Luckily, this jet is equipped with 4 engines, and we still have 3 functional engines! Because of the engine issues we will be arriving at our destination 30 minutes later than scheduled."" The passengers all groaned and went back to sleeping, reading, and watching their movies. Not long afterwards, they felt more turbulence, and again heard the pilot say, ""OK so we just lost our second engine, but not to worry, we are still running well on two engines. We will arrive at our destination 1 hour later than scheduled."" The passengers exchanged worried looks and started talking among themselves. Again, they felt the jet dip and rumble, and again, they heard the pilot say, ""We lost our third engine, and we will arrive 2 hours later than scheduled at our destination. My apologies for the inconveniences this delay is causing all of you."" This time, a frustrated looking passenger wearing a business suit stood up and yelled, ""At this rate, if we lose another engine, we'll never get there!""",0.0000483646,0.0000385760

Thankfully, the store is pretty empty, so there isn't a line, and he buys the flowers without delay. Then, he goes to the limo rental to rent a luxurious Cadillac limo, just for him and his girlfriend. Miraculously, no one else is getting a limo, so the limo line is empty, and he easily manages to rent the limo. Finally, the night of the prom arrives. The two are dancing happily and his girlfriend is having a great time. When the song is over, she asks him to get her some punch, so he heads over to the punch table and sees a very long line of people. He looks back at his girlfriend for a moment, and suddenly, all the people waiting for the punch, see him and immediately start running towards him.

He drives up to the farm, gets out of the car with his briefcase, and walks up to the door. On his way, he glances at the fenced in area attached to the barn where he sees a large hog staring at him. He does a classic double-take as it registers on him that this pig only has 3 legs. He knocks on the door and an old farmer in overalls answers. ""Howdy, sir, I'm working with United Insurance and I'm here---well doggone it, I just gotta ask you first: I noticed your pig only has three legs. What's the story?"" The farmer spits and say, ""Well, you see, a few years back my wife left the stove on at night. The flame caught a greasy napkin and while we were sleeping the kitchen caught fire and the house filled with smoke. Of course, we never would have known that except for that pig. That pig must've smelled the smoke, hopped the fence, busted into the house and damned if he didn't drag me, the missus, my youngest son, and the cat out of our beds and onto the front lawn. Firemen showed up and doused it before the whole house went up but that pig saved our lives."" ""And that's how he lost his leg? Saving you?"" ""Nah, that wasn't it. See about a year ago--this is about a year after the fire--a couple desperate fellas broke out of prison and stole a car. The cops were hot on their tail but these two lost 'em and headed out as far into the sticks as they could. They pulled up here at the farm. These two tied us all up, grabbed all our money and belongings and were arguing about how to kill us when that pig busts right through the barn door, launches himself at the first con knocking him out. He grabbed the guy's gun in his mouth, aimed it at the second one and darned if he didn't stare that second one down so bad he dropped his gun and surrendered to the pig. The pig frees us and we called the cops who hauled them both back to jail."" ""So the pig--he lost his leg in the tussle?"" ""Naw, not then. No, about six months ago--about April--we were doing our taxes. We'd had a couple bad years with crops and such and we just couldn't see how we could avoid losing the place. We were in a terrible place. Now that pig, somehow he gets into the office in the barn, sees all the forms and paperwork. He stayed up all night while were asleep, crunching numbers, shifting figures from one place to the next, discovering a few little pockets of savings we forgot about. Well, I tell you, I was astounded. There on the desk was my tax form and not only were the finances in good enough shape to keep the farm, we got a tidy little return to boot."" ""Ok, that's great, but how in the hell did the pig lose his leg doing that?"" ""Oh, it's like this, mister: A pig like that you don't eat all at once."" ",0.3299647570,0.1846668273

It's really no place for a penguin to be stuck in the desert for long."" The gas station attendant replies ""You're second in the queue, I'll get you taken care of as soon as possible."" The relieved penguin says, ""That's amazing, thank you so much. But being a penguin in the desert, I need a place to stay cool. Is there any place to eat with air conditioning around here?"" The gas station attendant says ""Yes, there's a Baskin Robins right across the street."" The penguin heads across the street to the Baskin Robins and orders 20 scoops of vanilla ice cream. He uses his flippers and shovels down a bunch of ice cream when the waitress gets a call. She comes over to the penguin and says ""Your car is ready, sir."" So the penguin pays for his ice cream and heads back to the gas station. He asks the gas station attendant ""So, what was wrong with my car?"" The gas station attendant looks up at him and says ""It looks like you blew a seal."" The penguin replies and points, ""No no, vanilla ice cream""",0.0000826528,0.0001530943

9186,7,A Christmas Myth,"After learning about different ways to celebrate Christmas, the children were eager to learn more about the subject. Knowing that one of the teachers at their school was from the UK and maybe had an angel on top of the tree instead of the classic star, they went to ask him about it. It's a long story he said: It began a very, very long time ago. It was a cold and snowy day, as it usually is on the North Pole. December was almost halfway passed already, but still, no decoration were in place. The elves couldn't make time to decorate as they were busy making toys. And Father Christmas was in a very, very bad mood. So the Christmas angel figured he had to do something to cheer him up so Christmas would be joyful as always. Thus, he cleaned the workshop and the house, tossed out the old take away leftovers and went to look for the decorations. Approaching Father Christmas he asked: \-What should I do with these decorations? The angel asked. \-I don't care, leave me alone! Father Christmas hissed back. The angel figured he put up the decorations and give Father Christmas another day. Maybe the clean house and the decorations would cheer him up. And the next day the angel went to Father Christmas to ask about how he should organize the Christmas gifts on the sleigh. \-I don't care, leave me alone! Father Christmas hissed again. The angel, not admitting defeat just yet. He let another day pass and figured he should put up the Christmas tree while he were on it. Not entirely sure where to put it, as it never was in the same spot for two years in a row, he meekly approached Father Christmas, hoping he would be in a better mood as Christmas was very, very close. \-Where do you want the Tree? The angel asked. \-As far as I'm concerned ..., said Father Christmas. You can take the tree and SHOVE IT UP YOUR... \-And that's the story of how the Christmas angel got on top of the Christmas tree.",0.0000673758,0.0000842720

So, with the approval of the priests, the friars began selling flowers from the Church's magnificent garden. They were a hit, and soon the flower money was rolling in in droves. A few days after they start, however, Tony, the local florist comes to the church in a huff. ""Please,"" he begs of the friars, ""you must stop selling flowers! Everyone wants to buy flowers from the men of God, so nobody comes to my business! I'll be ruined if you keep this up."" ""We're sorry,"" the friars tell him, ""but the doors of Hod's temple must remain open, and for that we need money."" Tony leaves the church, even more upset. He goes to his neighbors asking if they'll help him boycott, but they're all too afraid to speak out. lawyer, seeing if he can solve this legally, but the lawyer won't dare try and sue the church. He even goed to the governor, but he gets told Church isn't doing anything wrong. The week rolls by, and the Friars grow more successful as Tony gets closer to broke. Finally, in desperation, he hires the meanest, baddest, most nasty man in town, Hue, and sends him after the Friars. Hue scares all the firars, smashes all their tables, rips up the garden beds, and even pisses all over the remaining flowers. The next day, the Friars are no longer selling flowers, and Tony is back in business. In the end, it seems the saying is true: Hue and only Hue can prevent florist friars.",0.0000366628,0.0051563149

The real cause of what happened today was Australian government allowing to import and to produce eggs in their country in the first place.

9464,6,[LONG] A few lumberjacks were realxing around a campfire after a long days work...,"They had cracked open a couple of beers and were telling stories of the biggest trees they've cleared, and how easily they fell after 9 or 10 swings of their axe. The biggest, burliest man speaks up after a few men had spoken and says, ""That's nothing. I can cut down trees twice the size of that in just 6 chops."" From the other side of the fire, someone says, ""That's impressive alright. But, I can cut down trees of that size with just 2 swings of my axe."" The lumberjacks pause for a second, and take a look at the man who said that: a tall and scrawny older man who didn't even look like he could swing an axe. They burst into laughter. The older man let them calm down before he began again. He said, ""Alright, if you don't believe me, lets put it to the test then. You pick the strongest man from your group and find 2 evenly sized trees. I guarantee I'll knock it down in less swings than him."" The other lumberjacks, holding back their laughter now, look up and pick the biggest and strongest guy in their group. They find 2 large and evenly sized trees. The strongest man steps up to his tree and takes a swing. Then he takes 5 more well placed swings and the tree falls. He looks over at the old man and says, ""Ok, your turn."" The old man steps up to his tree and, sure enough, in two swings of his axe, the tree falls. The other lumberjacks look at him with awe as they gather around the fire again. Finally, one of them breaks the silence with a gentle question. ""How'd you do it? You don't even look like you can swing an axe and yet you took down the biggest tree we could find with just 2 swings!"" The old man paused and looked around the group. ""Have you ever heard of the Sahara Forest?"" he asked. ""You mean the Sahara Desert?"" asked one of the other lumberjacks. The old man looked back with a smile and said, ""so is that what they're calling it now?""",0.0003590040,0.0002802233

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework. 'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

9703,6,"Far away in the tropical waters of the Caribbean, two prawns were swimming around in the sea - one called Justin and the other called Christian.","The prawns were constantly being harassed and threatened by sharks that inhabited the area. Finally one day Justin said to Christian, 'I'm fed up with being a prawn; I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten.' A large mysterious cod appeared and said, 'Your wish is granted', and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark. Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate. Time passed and Justin found life as a shark boring and lonely. All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them. Justin didn't realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight. While swimming alone one day he saw the cod again and he thought that perhaps he fish could change him back into a prawn. He approached the cod and begged to be changed back, and, lo and behold, he found himself turned back into a prawn. With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail. Looking around the gathering at the reef he realised he couldn't see his old pal.' Where's Christian?' he asked.' He's at home, still distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark', came the reply. Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's abode. As he opened the coral gate memories came flooding back. He banged on the door and shouted, 'It's me, Justin, your old friend, come out and see me again.' Christian replied, 'No way man, you'll eat me. you're now a shark, the enemy and I'll not be tricked into being your dinner.' Justin cried back ' No, I'm not. That was the old me.

His commander gives him a tour of the somewhat dilapidated fort, and of its surrounding local villages. ""You see"", says the commanding officer, ""it's mostly camels and dust, but we do our best to keep up the morale of our men. On Mondays, we take the entire garrison out for an evening of drinks and carousing. Do you drink?"" ""Err, not really."" stammers the young officer. ""Hmm,"" says the commander. ""On Tuesdays, we bring the troops to the local opium den. Do you smoke?"" ""I'm afraid I do not."" replies the young officer, apologetically. The commander, concerned that the puritanical nature of his new officer will result in him hating this posting, tries harder. ""On Wednesdays, we allow all the men an evening of pleasure at the brothels!"" The young officer whispers with downcast eyes, ""That just wouldn't seem proper, sir."" A flash of anger comes over the commander's face, which turns to frustration, and then narrow-eyed suspicion. ""You don't drink, you don't smoke, and you won't enjoy yourself with women. Surely you're not one of those .. homosexuals?"" ""My goodness, no!"" protested the young officer. ""Well then,"" says the commander.

9730,6,A very Canadian joke,"It's Grey Cup weekend in Vancouver... the Stampeders are playing the Argonauts at BC Place, and fans are flying in from all over the country to watch the game and join in the festivities. It's kind of chaotic at the domestic arrivals terminal at YVR. Air Canada and WestJet flights are arriving from all over the country, bringing CFL fans from everywhere, many of whom are already fully dressed in their team's colours and partying it up. An American couple is also there, having recently arrived to Vancouver to catch a cruise ship that's on a short, repositioning trip, and they have no idea what's going on. They're looking at all of the craziness around them, and spot a couple of Rider Nation fans, fully decked-out as only Roughrider fans can be; dressed in green and white from head to toe, faces painted green and white, horns, cowbells, the whole deal.

The brick smashed through the windshield and the rope got caught in the steering wheel."" ""No way!"" Says the bartender. ""That's not the half of it "" says Bob as he takes another swig of beer. The moron kid had wrapped the rope around his arm. With the rope caught in the steering wheel, it pulled his arm right off! By now, half the bar was around Bob listening to his story, ""but why did you go to prison! "" Everyone said. ""Well"" continued Bob, ""that's the funny part. When the police arrived and we all tell our story, they said I was under arrest."" Everyone in the bar is flabbergasted, they can't believe Bob was the one charged, ""why would you be charged?

The man regretted his negligence, but since he had spent a million dollars on the creature, he decided to try if it still worked when dead. When the madam of the bordello came to collect payment for the night, the man tried to ask for 90% off. But the madam shook her head. ""I can't give that to you.

10136,5,The Talking Cat.,"A 2 bit magician had a show called ""Goldie, the Magic Talking Cat"". He wasn't that skilled of a magician, so he had to make up for his lack of talent with cheesy 2 bit tricks. He found this cat that looked like it was clearly abandoned. It had fleas and ticks, wasn't fixed and it didn't have a collar. So he adopted the cat, cleaned it up and got the cat fixed. He gave him the name ""Goldie"" because of his golden orange fur. So he had an idea on how to make money from his new pet. He was going to advertise his pet as ""a talking cat"" and take it to magic shows. The cat loved to meow all the time, so he thought he could make his money off of the cat's meows. The man showed off his talking cat at his show. He had his tip jar ready. After a few mundane magic tricks, the man pulled out the main attraction: The talking cat. He then asked the cat ""Hey Goldie, what's the name of one of China's former leaders?"" The cat said ""Mao"" The crowd chuckled and thought it was cute. A few people tipped him. But they still wanted to see the cat speak. The man did a magic trick in front of the cat. The disappearing kitty treat. The cat then went ""Wow"". ""See that?"" the man cried. ""That cat said wow!"" The crowd rolled their eyes. He got a few coins in his tip jar for the trick itself. The magician, sensing that the crowd would turn on him, got desperate. ""Hey Goldie, where does milk come from"" The cat then said ""Cow"" The crowd walked off and groaned. As the crowd walked off, the cat said ""Some cultures drink goat and sheep's milk. We just drink cow's milk in America due to cultural differences. Also, I would say the Wu Sangui was a former Chinese leader, but few Westerners know of his existence. And I didn't want to swear in front of the kids, so I said 'wow' The tip jar is this way, folks.

'Sure sir. A 100cm it shall be.' 'Ha! I got you! My underwear size is 95cm. Beat that.' Bill said. 'But sir, that's not possible.' 'Why?' 'Because if you wear a 95cm underwear, it will squish your balls and you might feel an excruciating pain.'",0.9653721452,0.0124710044

10299,5,Murphy and O'Brien calculate the depth of a well,"Murphy and O'Brien go out into the woods, they come a clearing and see an abandoned well. Murphy said 'I wonder how deep that well is?' O'Brien said, 'There's one way we could figure it out'. Murphy says, 'What's that?' O'Brien says, 'We drop something down it, we time how long it takes to hit the bottom, you multiply that time 32 feet per second squared, the rate at which objects fall in a vacuum, subtract a little for wind resistance and we've got the depth of the well'. Murphy says, ' What are you going to drop down it?' Then O'Brien looked all around and he saw this big heavy log lying on the ground. Next he squats down by the log and, using his legs correctly, he gets it up onto his shoulders and staggers over to the edge of the well, tips it up, drops it into the well and they start to count, 'One hippopotamus, two hippopotamus, three .................... ' SPLASH!!!! Murphy said, 'Three seconds!' O'Brien said, 'Quick, multiply that time 32 feet per second squared!' '288 feet!', Murphy said. 'Subtract a little for wind resistance, let's say 18 feet. The depth of that well is 270 feet deep'. As he finished the calculation Murphy shouts, 'LOOK OUT!!' and he pushed O'Brien backwards and a goat ran between them and jumped head first down the well. Murphy said, 'My God, I've never seen anything like that'. Just then a farmer walks into the clearing and said, 'What's going on here boys?' O'Brien says, 'We just figured out the depth of this well to be about 270 feet deep and then the strangest thing happened. A goat ran between the two of us and jumped head first down into the well.' The farmer says, 'Thank heaven it wasn't one of my goats.' Murphy says, 'How do you know it wasn't?' And the farmer says, 'Because all of my goats are tethered to big heavy logs.'",0.0000472729,0.0001198055

Joe grabs a huge net out from the cab, and a sharp pointed stick, then takes a large ladder from the top of the truck.

My specially trained attack dog will bite the gorilla on the testicles, freezing him in pain, I'll come down, throw the net on the gorilla and we can then put him in the cage.""

I turn around once more and i see a huge casket, ones you use for bodies during burials, just hopping towards me on the street! &#x200B; I stat to run and that is when i realised, its chasing me. I turn to knock at a nearby house for help, no answer. I see the casket getting closer and closer so i do what anyone would do, break the door open. I run inside the house, close the door and push against it hoping the casket wont know where i am. However after a few second of silence, BANG BANG BANG. It is trying to break the door down, i retreat to the stairs of the house as i watch to see if it will get in. But then silence, i wonder 'is it gone' however suddenly it crashes through the door! I run up the stairs, watching as it is following me still! I lock myself in the bathroom, i realise i have cornered myself. &#x200B; The casket starts to pound against the door, it was then that i realised i must fight back. So i gather all the items in the bathroom, i grab the toothbrushes to use as little swords against the casket, i empty out the medicine cabinet at my feet to use as throwing weapons. It was at this moment that the banging stopped again, 10 seconds went by, i began to think it had gone away! However, suddenly it bursts through the door! I throw the toothbrushes at it, no good. I throw toilet roll in hopes to trip it up, no good. I look down in panic hoping to find one last hope, when suddenly i spot the cough syrup. I pick the cough syrup, and i throw it at the casket, and yanno what happened? &#x200B; The coffin stopped. &#x200B; im sorry",0.0000957829,0.0005656699

At the sight, Adam did stare, There was Eve's treasure, All covered with hair. And wonder came, Under Eve's eyes, As Adam's thing, Started to rise. They found a spot, That suited them best, A nice big tree, Where they began to rest. Her legs spread wider, And wider apart, While thrill after thrill, Came into her heart. The head of Adam's thing, Peeked into the hole, And filled her with passion, Beyond her control. Backward and forward, His thing did slide, And Eve's treasure, Was all wet inside. The joy was good, She wouldn't let loose, Until Adam's thing, Was all out of juice. Then down through the years, People did screw, And now it is time, For me and you. So pull down your pants, And lay in the grass, Cause I'm in the mood, For a piece of that ASS! ",0.0000729443,0.9816485643

""Look, man, I know you don't like Coors, but I sell it here every day. It may not be your favorite, but Coors is a quality American beer and a lot of people like it."" The redneck replied, ""Nah, Coors is garbage! The last time I drank a 12-pack of Coors, I blew chunks!"" The bartender finally understood: ""Well, of course you blew chunks! If you drink a 12-pack of anything, you're probably going to throw up."" ""No, man, you don't get it."" The redneck replied, ""Chunks is my dog!""",0.0017394844,0.9062535167

So they pick up a few pebbles and throw them in and wait. Nothing. There's no noise. The first guy says, ""Jeeez. That is really deep. I know, let's throw one of these great big rocks down there. Those should make a noise."" So they pick up a couple football-sized rocks and toss them into the hole and wait... and wait... Again, nothing. They look at each other in amazement. Then the first guy gets a determined look on his face and says, ""Hey, over here in the weeds, there's a railroad tie. Help me carry it over. When we toss that sucker in, it's gotta make some noise."" So the two of them drag the heavy tie over to the hole and heave it in. Once again, not a sound comes from the hole. Suddenly, out of the nearby woods, a goat appears, running like the wind. It rushes toward the two men, then right past them, running as fast as it's legs will carry it. Suddenly it leaps in the air and into the hole. The two men are astonished with what they've just seen and look at each other in amazement. Then, out of the woods comes a farmer who spots the men and ambles over. He asks them, ""Hey, you two guys seen my goat out here?"" The first guy says, ""You bet we did! Craziest thing I ever saw. It came running like crazy and just jumped into this hole and disappeared!"" ""No"", says the farmer, ""That couldn't have been my goat.

As they are hiking through the forest, they come across two large black bears. The guide tells him to be quiet and not move and the bears should be on their way. Moshe ignores this advice, grabs his camera as as he's about to take a picture, one of the bears grabs the tour guide and eats him whole. Moshe hightails it out of there and after what seemed to be hours of running, he comes across the forest ranger. He tells the ranger the story and the ranger asks Moshe to lead him to the spot. After a long walk, they come to the clearing and both bears are still there, but there is no sign of the tour guide. The ranger asks Moshe which bear the guide is in as he needs to euthanize the right bear as it would be dangerous for tours. Moshe points to the male bear and said, it was definitely that one. The ranger pulls out his rifle, shoots the bear and the female one scurries off in fear. He pulls out his knife, cuts the bear open and nothing.

The second thinks longer and finally says ""I wish I was the richest man alive."" the genie nods, he checks his bank account and boom trillions of dollars, maybe more. The third scratches his chin thinking long and hard, he clicks his fingers and says ""I wish my left arm moved in a circle clockwise for the rest of my life."" the genie nods once again and the man's arm begins to move in a clockwise rotation. ""That's your first set of wishes complete."" the genie reminds them. The first man speaks again ""I wish I was married to the most beautiful woman in the world!"" the genie snaps his fingers and the most amazing, perfect woman appears from nowhere and wraps her arms around the first man. The second man smirks and says ""I wish I had the natural charisma and charm to get any woman I like."" suddenly the man feels more confident, he looks more handsome, he flirts with the first man's wife and she even flirts back a little. The third man smiles knowingly ""I wish my right arm moved counter clockwise for the rest of time."" and just like that, his right arm begins to rotate counter clockwise. ""Third and final wishes."" the genie reminds them all once more. The first pipes up again ""I wish I was in perfect health for the rest of my life!"" the genie nods and the man's complexion looks better, his back stops hurting even the tickle in his throat disappears. ""I wish I was 25 years old forever."" the second man speaks, and his wish is granted and he loses a few wrinkles here and there, gets a more youthful glow. Happy with their wishes, the two turn to the third man who is wearing the biggest, smuggest smile. ""I wish my head moved backwards and forwards forever."" With a 'poof' his head begins to move backward and forward. He smiles with glee. The genie thanks the men, the men thank the genie and they all go on their separate ways. Years later, they decide to meet again at a restaurant. The first man arrives first in a designer suit, his stunning wife under his arm. The second arrives looking even more glamorous and the two talk. ""My life couldn't be better."" The first says ""I invested the million I got and made even more money and invested that! Now I'm one of the richest men on earth, I haven't had a cold not even a runny nose for years and I'm married to the most beautiful woman who is also amazing in the sack."" He laughs with joy.

I haven't aged a day, feel like I'm in my prime and I tell you, I think you're wife is pretty great in the sack too."" He says with a wink. Finally, the third man shows up.

11012,4,So there's this musician.....,"So theres this musician who is incredibly gifted. Any instrument he touches he can instantly play at a masters level. Unfortunately for the musician he lived in a country ruled by a dictator. One day the dictator learns of the musician's talent and has the musician brought before him. The dictator gives the musician a task: compose and conduct a symphony to be played at the next political rally. Having no choice the musician agrees. He toils day and night for the next month, feverishly trying to create the perfect composition. When the day of the rally comes the musician confidently strides on stage, bows to the dictator, *tap tap taps* his baton on the music stand, and begins conducting. And the most godawful sound comes from the orchestra. Like nails on a chalkboard bad. The dictator is furious. He orders the musician to be executed the next day. After he's thrown in jail for the night, the musician asks if he can have a last meal. After deliberating the guards decide it wouldn't hurt anything. The musician orders the hottest curry the guards could find. As hot as it could possibly be. And he eats all of it right down to the last bit. The next morning comes and the guards haul the musician out of his cell, drag him to the execution chamber, and strap him into the electric chair. As they throw the switch the lights begin to flicker, smoke starts billowing, and there's a massive *POP*. The guards quickly turn off the power and start peering through the dissipating smoke. Much to their surprise the musician is sitting there unharmed. They quickly get the dictator on the phone and explain that the musician is still alive. The dictator decides to see the miracle musician for himself. Once the dictator arrives he sees the musician, who seems to be in a jovial mood. Enraged the dictator throws the electric chair switch again. Once again the lights begin to flicker, smoke starts billowing, and there's a massive *POP*. The dictator slowly turns off the power and allows the smoke to clear. Sure enough the musician is unscathed. ""How?! How are you still alive?!"" the dictator yells. The musician contemplates his answer for a moment and replies, ""Well, you see, I am an incredible musician. But sir...... I'm a terrible conductor.""",0.0000371665,0.0035563780

11106,4,Macaroni and Beef,"This is not original, and not me, it is actually quite old (at least 1996) but I have not seen it here so here goes... &#x200B; Macaroni and Beef &#x200B; A couple of weeks ago we decided to cruise out to Ryan's Steakhouse for dinner. It was a Wednesday night which means that macaroni and beef was on the hot bar, indeed the only night of the week that it is served. Wednesday night is also kid's night at Ryan's, complete with Dizzy the Clown wandering from table to table entertaining the little bastards. &#x200B; It may seem that the events about to be told have little connection to those two circumstances, but all will be clear in a moment. &#x200B; We went through the line and placed our orders for the all-you-can-eat hot bar then sat down as far away from the front of the restaurant as possible in order to keep the density of kids down a bit. Then I started my move to the hot bar. Plate after plate of macaroni and beef were consumed that evening, I tell you -- in all, four heaping plates of the pseudo-Italian ambrosia were shoved into my belly. I was sated. Perhaps a bit too much, however. &#x200B; I had not really been feeling well all day, what with a bit of gas and such. By the time I had eaten four overwhelmed plates of food, I was in real trouble. There was so much pressure on my diaphragm that I was having trouble breathing. At the same time, the downward pressure was building. At first, I thought it was only gas which could have been passed in batches right at the table without too much concern. &#x200B; Unfortunately, that was not to be. After a minute or so it was clear that I was dealing with explosive diarrhea. It's amazing how grease can make its way through your intestines far faster than the food which spawned the grease to begin with, but I digress... &#x200B; Entering, I saw two sinks immediately inside the door, two urinals just to the right of the sinks, and two toilet stalls against the back wall. One of them was a handicapped bathroom. Now, normally I would have gone to the handicapped stall since I like to stretch out a bit when I take a good shit, but in this case, the door lock was broken and the only thing I hate worse than my wife telling me to stop cutting my toenails with a pair of diagonal wire cutters is having someone walk in on me while I am taking a shit. I went to the normal stall. In retrospect, I probably should have gone to the large, handicapped stall even though the door would not lock because that bit of time lost in making the stall switch proved to be a bit too long under the circumstances. By the time I had walked into the regular stall, the pressure on my ass was reaching Biblical proportions. I began ""The Move."" &#x200B; For those women who may be reading this, let me take a moment to explain ""The Move."" Men know exactly what their bowels are up to at any given second. And when the time comes to empty the cache, a sequence of physiological events occur that can not be stopped under any circumstances. There is a move men make that involves simultaneously approaching the toilet, beginning the body turn to position ones ass toward said toilet, hooking ones fingers into ones waistline, and pulling down the pants while beginning the squat at the same time. It is a very fluid motion that, when performed properly, results in the flawless expulsion of shit at the exact same second that ones ass is properly placed on the toilet seat. Done properly, it even assures that the choad is properly inserted into the front rim of the toilet in the event that the piss stream lets loose at the same time; it is truly a picture of coordination rivaling that of a ballet dancer. &#x200B; I was about half-way into ""The Move"" when I looked down at the floor and saw a pile of vomit that had been previously expelled by one of those little bastards attending kids night; it was mounded up in the corner so I did not notice it when I had first walked into the stall. Normally, I would not have been bothered by such a thing, but I had eaten so much and the pressure upward was so intense, that I hit a rarely experienced gag reflex. And once that reflex started, combined with the intense pressure upward caused by the bloated stomach, four plates of macaroni and beef started coming up for a rematch. What happened next was so quick that the exact sequence of events are a bit fuzzy, but I will try to reconstruct them as best I can. &#x200B; In that moment of impending projectile vomiting, my attention was diverted from the goings-on at the other end. To put a freeze frame on the situation, I was half crouched down to the toilet, pants pulled down to my knees, with a load of vomit coming up my esophagus. Now, most of you know that vomiting takes precedence over shit no matter what is about to come slamming out of your ass. It is apparently an evolutionary thing since shitting will not kill you, but vomiting takes a presence of mind to accomplish so that you do not aspirate any food into the bronchial tubes and perhaps choke to death. My attention was thus diverted. At that very split second, my ass exploded in what can only be described as a wake...you know, as in a newspaper headline along the lines of ""30,000 Killed in Wake of Typhoon Fifi"" or something similar. In what seemed to be most suitably measured in cubic feet, an enormous plug of shit the consistency of thick mud with embedded pockets of greasy liquid came flying out of my ass. &#x200B; But remember, I was only half-way down on the toilet at that moment. The shit wave was of such force and of just such an angle in relation to the back curve of the toilet seat that it ricocheted off the back of the seat and slammed into the wall at an angle of incidence equal to the angle at which it initially hit the toilet seat. Then I sat down. Recall that when that event occurred, I was already half-way to sitting anyway and had actually reached the point of no return. I have always considered myself as relatively stable gravitationally, but when you get beyond a certain point, you're going down no matter how limber you may be. Needless to say, the shit wave, though of considerable force, was not so sufficient so as to completely glance off the toilet seat and deposit itself on the walls, unlike what you would see when hitting a puddle with a high-pressure water hose; even though you throw water at the puddle, the puddle gets moved and no water is left to re-form a puddle. There was a significant amount of shit remaining on about one third of the seat rim which I had now just collapsed upon. Now, back to the vomit... &#x200B; While all the shitting was going on, the vomit was still on its way up. By the time I had actually collapsed on the toilet, my mouth had filled up with a goodly portion of the macaroni and beef I had just consumed. OK, so what does the human body instinctively do when vomiting? One bends over. So I bent over. I was still sitting on the toilet, though. Therefore, bending over resulted in me placing my head above my now slightly opened legs, positioned in between my knees and waist. Also directly above my pants which were now pulled down to a point just midway between my knees and my ankles. Oh, did I mention that I was wearing not just pants, but sweat pants with elastic on the ankles. In one mighty push, some three pounds of macaroni and beef, two or three Cokes, and a couple of Big, Fat Yeast Rolls were deposited in my pants...on the inside...with no ready exit at the bottom down by my feet. &#x200B; In the next several seconds, there were a handful of farts, a couple of turds, and the event ended, yet I was now sitting there with my pants full of vomit, my back covered in shit that had bounced off the toilet, spattered on three ceramic tiled walls to a height of about five feet, and still had enough force to come back at me, covering the back of my shirt with droplets of liquid shit. All while thick shit was spread all over my ass in a ring curiously in the shape of a toilet seat. And there was no fucking toilet paper. &#x200B; What could I do but laugh. I must have sounded like a complete maniac to the guy who then wandered into the bathroom. He actually asked if I was OK since I was laughing so hard I must have sounded like I was crying hysterically. I calmed down just enough to ask him if he would get the manager. And told him to have the manager bring some toilet paper. When the manager walked in, he brought the toilet paper with him, but in no way was prepared for what happened next. I simply told him that there was no way I was going to explain what was happening in the stall, but that I needed several wet towels and I needed him to go ask my wife to come help me. I told him where we were sitting and he left. At that point, I think he was probably assuming that I had pissed just a bit in my pants or something similarly benign. &#x200B; About two minutes later, my wife came into the bathroom not knowing what was wrong and with a certain amount of worry in her voice. I explained to her (still laughing and having trouble getting out words) that I had a slight accident and needed her help. Knowing that I had experienced some close calls in the past, she probably assumed that I had laid down a small turd or something and just needed to bring the car around so we could bolt immediately. Until I asked her, I'm sure she had no idea that she was about to go across the street and purchase me new underwear, new socks, new pants, a new shirt, and (by that time due to considerable leakage around the elastic ankles thingies) new sneakers. And she then started to laugh herself since I was still laughing. &#x200B; She began to ask for an explanation as to what had happened when I promised her that I would tell her later, but that I just needed to handle damage control for the time being. She left. &#x200B; The manager then came back in with a half dozen wet towels and a few dry ones. I asked him to also bring a mop and bucket upon which he assured me that they would clean up anything that needed to be cleaned. Without giving him specific details, I explained that what was going on in that stall that night was far in excess of what I would expect anyone to deal with, what with most of the folks working at Ryan's making minimum wage of just slightly above. &#x200B; At that moment, I think it dawned on him exactly the gravity of the situation. Then that manager went so far above the call of duty that I will be eternally grateful for his actions. He hooked up a hose. Fortunately, commercial bathrooms are constructed with tile walls and tile floors and have a drain in the middle of the room in order to make clean up easy. Fortunately, I was in a commercial bathroom. He hooked up the hose to the spigot located under the sink as I began cleaning myself up with the wet towels. Just as I was finishing, my wife got back with the new clothes and passed them into the stall, whereupon I stuffed the previously worn clothing into the plastic bag that came from the store, handing the bag to my wife. I finished cleaning myself off and carefully put on my new clothes, still stuck in the stall since I figured that it would be in bad taste to go out of the stall to get redressed in the event I happened to be standing there naked and some little bastard kid walked in. At that point, I had only made a mess; I had not yet committed a felony and intended to keep it that way. &#x200B; When I finished getting dressed, I picked up the hose and cleaned up the entire stall, washing down the remains toward the drain in the center of the room. I put down the hose and walked out of the bathroom. I had intended to go to the manager and thank him for all he had done, but when I walked out, three of the management staff were there to greet me with a standing ovation. I started laughing so hard that I thought I was going to throw up again, but managed to scurry out to the car where my wife was now waiting to pick me up by the front door. The upshot of all this is that I strongly recommend eating dinner at Ryan's Steak House. They have, by far, the nicest management staff of any restaurant in which I have eaten.",0.0001631432,0.0093019279

He had the sand analyzed at the lab and looked at the sack under a microscope he could never find anything wrong. This went on every day for the next month. After the officer retired, he ran into the bicyclist in a restaurant in Tijuana. After some small talk he said, ""Come on. I know you were smuggling something all that time. I won't tell. I'm just curious. What was it?"" The other man said, ""Bicycles.""",0.0006379891,0.0000627436

You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though. One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled. \-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve. \-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution. \-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person. \-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation. The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him. \-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life? \-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables. \-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job? \-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place. \-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours? \-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.",0.0000884695,0.0002120689

'Tell me, Fred, how did you lose your last name?' The biker replies, 'It's a long story, so stay with me.' I was born Fred Johnson. I studied hard and got good grades. When I got older, I realized that I wanted to be a doctor. I went through college, medical school, internship, residency, and finally got my degree, so I was Fred Johnson, MD. After a while I got bored being a doctor, so I decided to go back to school. Dentistry was my dream! Got all the way through School, got my degree, so then I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS. Got bored doing dentistry, so I started fooling around with my assistant and she gave me VD, so now I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS, with VD. Well, the ADA found out about the VD, so they took away my DDS. Then I was Fred Johnson, MD, with VD.

Ok heres a joke to make you chuckle, its a bumpy ride so use your buckle, There once was a bull named Fumanshoo, Fumanshoo ate grass until he grew, 900lbs was Fumanshoo, 900lbs of perfect beef stew, But Fuman had different plans in mind, He knew the farmer wanted to eat his kind.. Day by day he made his plan, no one was putting Fuman in the frying pan.. Fuman knew the farmer had a plane, and if he could steal it he could fly to Spain and see his girl friend once again.. One day the farmer pissed off the rooster, an intense battle, but Fuman had a chance to seize his future, He gave his fence bash and made his dash, Shots rang out as the motor cranked, But the plane was rolling to the cow gods he thanked, Fuman knew what he had to do, Fuman wanted to make farmer stew, He pointed the plane and was headed for the farmer, But deep down Fuman believed that there was karma, So instead of Fuman turning the farmer into Farmer stew, he simply ran the farmer into a big pile a Fuman poo...

After passing all questions, St. Peter asks, ""so far you have done well, but I have one final question to ask."" All men accept and ask what it is. St. Peter asks the first guy, ""How many times have you cheated on your wife?"" The first guy thinks to himself, ""Well, he already knows, so I may as well not lie."" He then says, ""I have cheated on my wife 5 times. Twice early on, twice later, and a final time because I found out she had cheated on me."" St. Peter points to an old looking SUV and says, ""You will drive around in this. Its not in the best shape, but it does work and you can have your friends in if you want,"" to which the first guy thanks him. St. Peter then turns to the second guy and asks him how many times he had cheated on his wife, to which the second guy responds with, ""I have only cheated on my wife once!"" St. Peter points to a red, sports car and says, ""You will be riding around in this. It is nice, fast and you will have some style in your car."" Then the first guy waited for St. Peter to ask him, and he proudly states that, ""I have not ever cheated on my wife, not once!"" St. Peter shows him a decked out limo, with drivers, a bar, and a table for poker and other games. The first guy is very grateful, and thanks St. Peter. The next day, the friends are enjoying there rides, and they decide to meet up. Though both guy 1 and 2 find guy 3 crying historically. ""What's wrong? You got that decked out limo, why could you possibly be sad?"" they said. Guy 3 looks up and says, ""I just say my wife riding on a skateboard!""",0.0002595655,0.0009244843

11415,3,Theory vs Reality.,"This is a long joke and if it's been posted before, sorry in advance. Twenty-five years ago a movie came out called Indecent Proposal. It was about a wealthy older man who offered $1 million to sleep with another man's wife. The older man in the movie was Robert Redford, a very famous and handsome man, so it was not really a tough choice to make. The joke starts off with a son asking his father ""what's the difference between theory and reality"". The father says, go ask your Mother if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the son asks his mother. She thinks about it for a few seconds and says, YES! of course I'd sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the boy goes back to his Father and says, ""Mom would would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million"". Then the Father tells his son to ask his sister if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the son asks his sister if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. She too thinks about it for a few seconds. ""Well he is old but he is still handsome and famous"". ""$1 million, is a lot of money"". ""Yes, I'd sleep with him for $1 million"". So the boy returns to his Father and says ""Yes, sis would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million"". ""But what has this got to do with answering my initial question""? The Father replies ""Well son, in theory, we are millionaires"". ""But in reality, we are living with two whores"". ",0.0000451271,0.2736147940

Excited at the prospect of helping the pope, the teacher readily agreed. The pope showed the teacher the puzzle. Everything in the puzzle was filled out, except for one thing. The word \_ I T C H.

After Karen took the kids and the money, John angrily said ""Karen, you fat \_\_\_\_\_!"" A nagging thought immediately popped into the teacher's mind, but he dismissed the thought immediately, thinking ""I couldn't possibly tell him that!"". Instead, he said ""Huh, what an interesting case. I too, am stumped."" The pope nodded and quietly mused to himself for a few minutes, before finally falling asleep. After a while of profuse thinking, the teacher woke the pope and said: ""Father, I believe the answer is WITCH."" ""Ah! Yes!"" The pope said happily, taking out an eraser.

The Trini persists: ""Do you eat jelly with the bread?"" The Guyanese replies: ""Of course we do."" Trini: (cracking his gum between his teeth and chuckling) ""We don't. In Trinidad, we eat fresh fruit for breakfast, then we put all the peels, seeds and leftovers in containers,recycle them, transform them into jam and sell the jam to Guyana"" The Guyanese then asks: ""Ayo rass a bugga in Trinidad?""

People can submit any pun they like in writing, to be read before the panel of judges, or bet on puns submitted by others. Steve read through some of the puns, and was genuinely *shocked,* and certainly *greatly* amused. He had found new puns! This was a rare thing for Steve, and he laughed so hard at these he was sure one of them would win.

""Oh!"" he cried, ""My loving wife of 78 years Lorraine has baked my favorite treat on this, my last day of life, most likely; chocolate chip cookies!"" And with that, Joe Balogey rolled off his bed and hit the floor, cracking three ribs and displacing both hips. Unable to stand, he clawed himself down the stairs inches at a time in agony as his frail body dragged across the cold wood floor. Still, the pain was worth every second as he reached the kitchen to see hundreds of chocolate chip cookies cooling upon the counters and table of their family home of so many years which Joe Balogey had built himself for his loving wife Lorraine 64 years before. ""Oh, my loving, dear, sweet, ever supporting wife, she's made such wonderful treats for me."" And as Joe reached up to grab a cookie off the table a wooden spoon smacked his hand sharply.

John was a normal cheerio, no money, no life, nothing. So one day he decided he was going to change that. John got up and decided to get a job at McDonalds. He worked his ass off everyday and he eventually got promoted to the manager of that McDonalds. John woke up the next day, looked in the mirror and realized he was a honey nut cheerio. Even though he became a honey nut cheerio, he wanted more. He kept working hard until he became the CEO of McDonalds. He woke up the next day and looked in the mirror, and he was a glazed cheerio. Glazed cheerios need to have a certain amount of sugar intake to maintain their beautiful glazed outside so John got right to that. The next day, John invited to a glazed cheerio only party that was meant for the biggest glazed cheerios in all the land. When he got there and was partying, he realized that he hadn't consumed enough sugar. Becoming a honey nut cheerio right there would be so embarrassing. So he ran to the cake and there was a huge line. He ran to the soda there was a smaller line, but still to long. Finally we went to the punch, and you know what, there is no punch line.

She tells me I need to get a topography test which couldn't be done at her office. Instead, she sent me to the Eye Center at a local hospital. While I was there, I asked if this was same building I would go when it came time for the actual procedure. They confirmed that it was. The time for the surgery came, and I show up at the same wing of the hospital, which was rather large. They apologized and said I was in the wrong building. I actually needed to go across the street which was a main road but was still considered part of the hospital. I asked the name of the building I was looking for, and they said it was the Urology building next to a Starbucks (go figure). I asked, ""Are you sure? I have to go to the Urology Center for eye surgery?"" Apparently, the Urology Center was the only building with rooms large enough to house the machine they used to perform the surgery. Everything went well once I found the building, and my eyes turned out fine.

The man nods and says, ""Yes, just take the next left, travel one block, and it will be on your right."" The first man thanks him and is on his way. Sure enough, he comes to a magnificent building coated in gold paint. He goes inside and tells the receptionist that he's here seeking an internship. She directs him to the interviewer's office. The interviewer says, ""Now, before we go over your qualifications, I want to give you a quick tour of the premises."" He leads him to a room and says, ""This is the harvesting room."" The man peers in and sees thousands of gold colored statues of all different sizes. Many workers are disassembling them with hammers, chisels, and Dremels and then separating the pieces into two giant bins. The man is confused, but holds his tongue. The interviewer then leads him to 'The Seeking Center'. Inside, workers are busy talking on the phone and browsing online auctions. The interviewer says, ""This is where we find and purchase the statues. We use Ebay, Amazon, thrift stores, antique shops, and any other means we can to find and buy statues at competitive prices."" The man is a little confused, but only nods and smiles. The interviewer then leads him to 'The Packaging Room'. Inside, workers are packaging scrotums of all different shapes and sizes that had been removed from the statues. The poor man is sweating, blushing, and frankly a little disgusted. The interviewer says, ""And those tubes over there lead straight to the shipping center and the gift shop! Alright, now let me see your resume."" The flustered man says, ""On second thought, maybe this job isn't for me. I have to go."" He rushes past the interviewer and walks briskly to the exit.

He kept trying, but everytime yielding the same results.

12281,2,Little Johnny overheard a couple of girls in school,"The kids were whispering ""Purple flowers, purple flowers,"" and giggling. Curious what this meant, Johnny asked his friend. ""Jimmy, what does purple flowers mean?"" Johnny asked. Little Jimmy looked at Johnny in horror and said ""I'm not gonna be friends with someone who says stuff like that!"" and ran away from Johnny. Johnny next asked the teacher ""Teacher, what does purple flowers mean?"" The teacher looks at Johnny, mortified, and says, ""I won't have kids saying that kind of language in my class. Go to the principal!"" Johnny heads to the principal's office and asked, ""Miss, what does purple flowers mean?"" The principal replies with, ""You are expelled, I won't have any students in my school speaking that kind of language!"" Johnny head to the bus stop, and once he gets on, he asks the bus driver, ""Mister, what does purple flowers mean?"" The bus driver pushes Johnny off the bus, and says, ""I won't have your cussing in my bus!"" Johnny walks all the way home, and after he gets there, he tells his parents he got expelled. His parents ask why, promising not to get too angry, and to let him off with a warning. ""Well, I asked the teacher what purple flowers means."" Johnny's mother faints from her son's foul language, and in anger, the father says, ""Get out, no son of mine will say such terrible things!"" Johnny heads to the homeless shelter, planning to ask the homeless people about you-know-what, but they were all passed out and drunk. He goes to the owner of the homeless shelter, who's standards were pretty low, and asked if he knew what purple flowers meant. The guy says no, but the old man who didn't give a shit about what people said might know. Then he tells Johnny to get the fuck out, because his language is a ""bad influence"" on the homeless people. Johnny goes to the old man, and knocks on his door. A short, grumpy guy with little hair and a lot of beard answers the door. Johnny says ""Excuse me sir, do you know what purple flowers means?"" The man says no, but the old lady who lives in a house faraway might know. Johnny, who's lost everything at this point, decides to go to this old lady's house, which was quite a distance away from the town he grew up in. Taking nothing but his wit and the clothes on his back, he started his journey. He crossed deserts with scorching heat and freezing nights, oceans teeming with hostile life, grassy plains and jungles full of Savage natives, going the route told to him by the old geezer. He had to prove that he was worthy to the savages by chopping off the genitals of an endangered species of pink panther in the Amazon. He crossed the vast Atlantic in a raft made from old Gatorade bottles he found on the beach. During his time at sea he was attacked by a rare blue footed booby, which was inexplicably in the middle of the Atlantic. He lost his foot to the monsterous boobies. He went to Egypt, where he killed a 100 year old vampire with the ability to stop time. He nourished himself with nothing but sand and spit. He grew into his teens, and then his 20's, until he finally reached West City (which was in the east of Egypt) to the lady's house, which was the southern area of northern Cario. The lady's house was just in front of him. Johnny, exhausted, limped across the road. He's so tired he doesn't notice the massive moving van coming directly at him. He has time to see the driver. It was Jimmy, his childhood friend, in a moving company's uniform. In his shirt pocket was a beautiful purple flower. It was the last sight Johnny would ever see. The blood that got smeared on the front of the van and in the road never went away. Well, I think we can all learn a very valuable lesson from Johnny's demise; that is, look both ways before crossing the road. ",0.0002659431,0.1324618608

When I got home, my husband seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly, ""Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight."" He then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, ""Happy Birthday!""",0.0000684169,0.0004053713

12924,1,"Twist & expansion of the ""fly in the beer"" story","A bar in FRANCE has an amateur social scientist as a bartender. He's decided to put flies into the beers of a customers, to measure and document the reactions of people of different nationalities. Since he fancies himself as a chivalrous gentleman, he doesn't do this with female customers (actually, he doesn't want to ruin any chance he has of getting them into his bed, or the back room.) So his targets are men. &#x200B; Here is his experiment journal. &#x200B; Monday: Subject #1: Englishman, age approximately 40. Called me over and said he couldn't drink the beer because of the fly and demanded another on the house. &#x200B; Subject #2: Welshman, age approximately 50-60. Called me over and flicked the fly at me while swearing in Welsh. Then he started sipping his beer as if nothing happened. &#x200B; Tuesday: Subject #3: Irishman, age approximately 65. Was so drunk that he didn't notice the fly, gulping it down with the beer, then ordered another ""jus' da same"". I obliged him. Four more flies later, he settled his tab, and made his way out of the bar in a less than straight line. &#x200B; Subject #4: American, age approximately 25. Yelled at me to come back, threw the beer in my face, and started a bar brawl. &#x200B; Wednesday: Dedicated to repairing bar, no customers. &#x200B; Thursday: Subject #5: Scotsman, age approximately 35. Horrified upon seeing the fly (I think you know where this is going), picked it out of the beer and screamed at it repeatedly, ""Spit it out! Spit it out!"". For the next beer, he demanded an extra ounce on the house, on account of the fly having drunk some of his previous beer. &#x200B; Subject #6: Canadian, age approximately 25-30. Very quiet. When he paid for his beer, the fly was on the Euro bills and he said, ""No thank you. You can have the fly back."" &#x200B; Friday: Subject #7: German, age approximately 30-40. Demanded to see the manager and complained to her that I had dishonoured his fine beverage. Suggested to my manager that I was unfit for my job, and that he deserved the most expensive beer we have for free as compensation. &#x200B; My manager questioned me about the fly, suspicious. She's smarter than I thought, despite her not sleeping with me. She asked me about the brawl on Tuesday, if I had done something to set off the American. I said it might be possible, but who knows what sets them off? She agreed, but warned me that if anything goes wrong during my shift again, I would lose my employee discount. &#x200B; Saturday: &#x200B; The owner is working today instead of the manager. Since the manager won't sleep with the owner either, he probably doesn't know about the fly incident. Onward with my experiment. &#x200B; Subject #8: Iranian, age approximately 20-50. Saw the fly, then praised Allah for showing him the error of his ways, then left. &#x200B; The owner didn't want the beer to go to waste, so put it into the refrigerator. He didn't notice the fly. &#x200B; Subject #9: Sudanese refugee, age 42. For some reason my knowing his age was important, like he was bragging. I gave him the beer that the owner put in the fridge. When he saw the fly, he started yelling loudly that he shouldn't be treated this way, that he should get the same as everyone else. The owner came over to see what was going on. He asked me why I was treating the refugee differently, I said that I wasn't, that I had been putting flies in most of the beers. He laughed and repeated this to the refugee, who spluttered and swore on his way out the door. &#x200B; ""Why are you putting flies in the beer?"", asked the owner. I told him about my experiment, minus the bar brawl. Obviously. &#x200B; ""Well, it's just beer, the cretins, they should have wine like us French. They deserve it,"" he replied, ""but don't do it too much. I don't want to lose too many customers."" &#x200B; I said, ""I'm only doing it to foreigners, but it would be interesting to see the reaction of a fellow Frenchman, if ever one orders a beer."" &#x200B; ""Don't you dare put a fly in the wine!"", growled the owner. &#x200B; ""Of, course Monsieur, I would never stoop so low!"" &#x200B; Saturday: &#x200B; Subject #10: A dark coloured American woman, age approximately 20-30. I broke my no women rule for her because she was extremely rude when I innocently asked her to the back room. When she saw the fly, she started screaming in some version of English that I couldn't understand, threw the beer at the owner (who came in specifically today to watch my experiment), jumped over the bar and hit me over the head with the beer stein. She and her 5 other young dark coloured American friends then started rampaging, smashing everything in sight. After what seemed like an eternity, they grabbed what few bottles were left unbroken and the cash from the cash box, before running out into the street. &#x200B; Sunday: &#x200B; The bar owner is in the hospital bed beside mine. He says that he has been telling me repeatedly that I am fired, but I keep forgetting it because of my head injury. &#x200B; ""That's OK, though, I love yelling it at you!

Incredulous, the guy watches as Paul waves his hand and magicky sparks fly out. With a burst of confidence, he toasts Paul and gets back up on the stage, pint in hand. The crowd recognizes him and starts to boo, but as he launches into Norwegian Wood, the crowd is mezmerized by the utter beauty of the performance. Thunderous applause follows. He follows up with another toast to Paul and a performance of Revolution, which leaves the crowd absolutely PUMPED! Victorious, he goes home for the night. Days later, he tries his luck again at a different pub. He orders a pint, toasts Paul (wherever he may be), launches into a performance of While My Guitar Gently Weeps at the mic, and the crowd can't get enough of it, going absolutely crazy. Before long, he has achieved a certain degree of fame for this talent of his. He makes his way onto a televised talent show. As he is nervously waiting behind stage, he realizes... he doesn't have his pint! The man calls a stagehand over and aggressively says, ""Beer! I need beer! There's beer in the green room, right?"" ""Uhhh... not beer, sir,"" the stagehand says, a bit frightened. ""But we do have booze."" ""Damn! What kinds of booze do you have?"" ""I can make you a margarita, a vodka and Red Bull, or a rum and coke."" ""Hrm... make me the vodka and Red Bull. And hurry!"" It's his turn to go on stage. Nervously, he toasts Paul with his mixed drink and goes on stage to sing Eleanor Rigby. However, the wrong words come out. He starts crooning, ""Someone's knockin' at the door. Somebody's ringin' the bell..."" The music stops awkwardly and he starts over. Again, the wrong words come out. ""When you were young, and your life was an open book..."" The crowd starts to boo. Frantically, the man looks around and lo and behold - he sees Paul McCartney sitting in the audience! ""Paul! You've got to help me!!! What went wrong?!?!"" Paul shakes his head and points at the drink. ""Red Bull gives you Wings.""",0.0002225931,0.0355705433

12970,1,A Polish man from a small village is flying for the first time.,"It's your standard 747 with four engines, and after some initial nervousness, the man, we'll call him Bart, is feeling at ease after a smooth takeoff and ascent. This is just a short flight from Warsaw to Berlin, and they should be landing in less than 2 hours. 20 minutes into the flight, a shudder is felt through the plane and the pilot comes on the loudspeaker, ""Folks, we have just lost power in one of our engines. Should be nothing to worry about, we will still be landing safely very soon"". Bart shrugged off the incident and figured if that's the worst thing that happens today, it would still be a success. A half hour later, another shudder went through the plane, the passengers gasped, and the pilot came on the PA again. ""Friends, we have lost power to another engine. We still have two functioning engines, and we should have no problems reaching our destination. We apologize for the issues."" Bart was starting to feel slightly uneasy now, but was still confident they would reach Berlin. Later, about 20 minutes out from their destination, another vibration was felt and the plane listed to the right for a few moments, then stabilized. The pilot made another announcement, this time more nervously, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have lost power to a third engine. We still hope to make it to Berlin safely, please remain calm."" Bart and the other passengers were now visibly shaken, praying that the last functional engine held out until they could land. Thankfully, the plane reached Berlin and landed safely. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief as they taxied to the gate and began to deplane. As Bart gathered his things, he laughed and remarked to the man seated next to him, ""It's a good thing we didn't lose that last engine, or we would have been up there all night!""",0.0000599611,0.0000383180

He sees two gentlemen working on fixing a small crack in the street, the only blemish for blocks. One of them is pounding down the clay with a wide-head sledgehammer, thwap thwap! The other is on his knees with a compass and a pick and a broom, adjusting the grade of the street material. He interrupts them to say, ""Excuse me gentlemen! I hate to be a bother, but I just want to applaud your hard work on this alleyway. It's rare a city takes such good care with its streets and this one is one of the best."" The man with the sledge stops and says, ""Well, we appreciate that sir. You know your streets, it seems! Would it surprise you to know that the composition of this street is not adobe? It's mulched with our native nut trees, the cashew nut. That's what gives it its softness. When it rains, the petrichor has a slight sweetness due to the cashew, and the town smells fantastic. I'm just hammering it down before it gets too cold."" ""Well, I'll be!"" cried the archaeologist. ""And what's that fellow up to?"" pointing to the man on his knees. ""Oh him!

I was one of their most valuable spies eight years running. But, the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger and I wanted to settle down. So, I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security work, mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings there and was awarded a batch of medals. Had a wife, a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired."" The man is amazed.

13074,1,The Brick,"Those askreddit threads reminded me of this old one. A man is building a house out of bricks. When it's finished he walks inside and finds a random brick in the middle of a room on the floor. Thinking to himself: ""I know I used every last brick to build this house. I wonder where this brick came from?"" He calls into the house his partner who helped him build the house and shows him the brick. The other man shrugs, picks up the brick, opens a window and throws the brick out of the window! Just like that, the man couldn't believe it! Across town, a bus was setting off on a long journey. On the bus was a man opening his book and settling in for the long journey ahead. After only a few minutes into the ride, a *yap yap yap* noise came from the seats behind him. The yapping continued until, fed up, the man jumped up and scowled over the seat to the woman behind him and her yapping dog. He bellows, ""Can you please quiet your dog!"" The woman returns his scowl with one of her own and says ""No! I will not silence my pet, it is a dog and I'm allowed to have it and dogs yap! Mind your own business!"" The man returns to his side of the seat and opens his window in hopes the fresh air helps calm him, and the sound of the wind drowns out the annoying yaps. *yap yap yap* The man lights up a cigar and begins to smoke. Taking long pulls and blowing the smoke making sure it's blown directly in the woman's direction. He feels a tap on his shoulder. The woman from the seat behind him is standing over his seat and coughing, she says: ""put that out! It's making me and my dog cough!"" ""No! I will not. I am allowed to have it! Mind your own business!"" he says with a wry smile. The woman angrily grabs the cigar and throws it out of the bus window. Then the man angrily stands up, grabs the dog and throws it out of the window. A few minutes of yelling and insults and the bus driver stops to handle the commotion. He orders them both off of the bus. Standing on the side of the road they notice something running towards them. It was the dog! And what do you think the dog had in it's mouth? The cigar? Nope.

13135,1,"How the Internet Started, According to the Bible"," In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a healthy young wife by the name of Dorothy. And Dot Com was a comely woman, large of breast, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com. And she said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?"" And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, dear?"" And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale, and they will reply telling you who hath the best price. The sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)."" Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent. To prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew. It was known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the People (HTTP). And the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS. And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work only with Brother Gates' drum heads and drumsticks. And Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known. He said, ""We need a name that reflects what we are."" And Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators."" ""YAHOO,"" said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com. Abraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside. It soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE). That is how it all began. And that's the truth.",0.0000378733,0.0001196014

I know this may be a little forward but I would love to grab coffee with you some time."" Flattered, the man responds, ""Sure... but what makes you so certain you and I would get along so well?"" ""Well..."" the woman says. ""A couple things, actually. I noticed you were wearing an Iron Maiden t-shirt. Iron Maiden are my favorite band of all time. When they went on their reunion tour in 1999, my parents took me to see them in Cleveland. I was 12 years old and it was the first concert I ever went to. I absolutely love Iron Maiden."" The man can't believe it. ""I saw them play Cleveland in '99! First concert I ever went to on my own. My best friend Jimmy Spitz and I told our parents we were sleeping at each others' houses, snuck out, took a bus into the city and saw them play at the Plain Dealer Pavilion!"" Naturally, they're both shocked. ""If that isn't weird enough..."" says the woman. ""I noticed you're reading Mark Twain. I was a communications major in university and I actually wrote my thesis on Mark Twain and how he used satire as a lens to comment on current events of the time, comparing him to satirical news sources of today. He's my favorite author."" Now the man is really taken aback, ""Get out of here! I was an English major in university! I specialized in 19th century American literature and this is like my fourth or fifth time reading Tom Sawyer, I absolutely love Mark Twain."" They both can't believe it...this has got to be a match made in heaven. ""Ok..."" the woman says. ""Well, buckle up because here's the icing on the cake. I noticed you're eating a prune. Prunes are my absolute favorite fruit. When I was a kid, my grandfather lived on a farm. He had an orchard that mainly grew apples and some lemons, but he knew how much my sister and I loved prunes so he kept a couple of plum trees. Every year at the end of the summer, we'd go up and harvest the plums with him. He'd dry them and by the time we'd go back to his place for Thanksgiving he'd always have those prunes saved just for us. They're my favorite fruit! I love prunes, you're eating a prune, this has got to be fate. What do you say?"" The man puts down his fruit and responds, *""It's a date!""*",0.0000557915,0.0000655395

13590,1,There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living...," He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas. ""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",0.0000413299,0.3594981730

After three months panning for gold he hasnt had any luck finding gold so to drown his sorrows he goes to the local whorehouse. He says to the man sitting at the front desk: ""I'd like a woman for the night"" to which the man replies: ""well we only have one girl available and i must warn you her nickname is sandpaper sally"" The man thinks about this for a minute and ultimately goes on his way Three months go by and he hasnt found any gold so he goes back to the whore house (increasingly more horny than he was before) and has a similar exchange with the man at the desk. Again the man goes on his way. Finally 6 more months goes by and hes finally found gold. So much gold in fact that hes richer than anyone ever should be. So he strolls back into the whorehouse and says to the man: ""I would like your finest woman for the night!"" The man responds: ""Well sir we only have one girl available and i must warn you her nickname is sandpaper sally"" Then man doesnt even hesitate and says: ""Alright fuck it lets go!"" So the man leads him upto a room and a few minutes later in walks the most drop dead gorgeous woman he's ever laid eyes on. Now keep in mind hes gone a year without sex so he skips the foreplay and just goes for it. And after a few thrusts he stops because it feels like there are two sheets of sandpaper rubbing along both sides of his dick. He pulls out and looks at her and says: ""Im sorry sally, i cant do this your vagina feels like sandpaper."" She responds: ""give me a few minutes"" And goes into the bathroom She comes out about 5 minutes later and asks him to try again and against his better judgement he does. Greatest sex hes ever had they go at it for hours. About 5 or 6 hours later theyre laying in bed and he looks at her and says: ""you went into the bathroom, what did you do?""

They start looking at the dog expecting it to start looking for the animal hiding in the hole, but the dog is so scared it starts howling. So they decided that the dog needs to get a proper training. There was a village next to theirs that was famous during the summertime, that time there were weddings almost every second day, and allot of shooting and dancing as a sign of celebration. So they wait out the spring, and they leave the dog in the summer. The summer passed and at the first days of autumn they went to get their dog. Now the hunting season was open, they went up the woods with their dog, after couple of hours searching for animals they spotted a hole in the ground, they started shooting at it BANG!

13958,1,The pianist (credits to u/GoldmanT),"/u/goldmant I remember hearing about a pianist who also fixed orchestras (booked players for concerts) who got put in prison for defrauding clients and musician contractors for hundreds of thousands of pounds, sentence was two years, expected to be out in 18 months. Inside, he only had one possession, a copy of Bartok's Piano Concerto No 2, one of the most difficult pieces in the repertoire. For a month he just stared at it, studied it, drank it in. Then he spread his fingers and just moved his downturned palms left and right as if covering the ground on an imaginary piano keyboard. The prison guards laughed at and taunted him, but as time went on they were just quietly curious. Other inmates quizzed him and he said he had never played the piece before but it was his life goal and he didn't want to waste his 'enforced recreation time'. This went on for months and through the bars the guards could see his fingers flying while his eyes were either up and closed or open and aimed right at the score; his cellmates would even turn the pages for him, they'd got so used to his repeated movements. He just looked like he was not only playing the concerto, but absolutely smashing it, like when someone looks so comfortable it's effortless. Word got out via visitors and visitors' acquaintances and eventually to the local paper who sent someone to the prison. Eventually the buzz spread and the increased attention, regional TV news etc, really started feeding the guy's ego - a group of his ex musician contractors got together and organised a low-budget orchestra to play the concerto with him on his release, which got national media attention which led to a larger and larger orchestra and eventually the city's concert hall as venue, ticket proceeds for charity, all sold out on the day of his release, concert scheduled for that evening.

14024,1,There was a new movie in town that everyone was talking about,"Since their first debut, Best E. Studios has released works of art to massive acclaim. With the upcoming release, everyone was understandably excited. On premiere night, everyone lined up at the theater for the first viewing. The namesake of the studio and director of the film, Edna, even made an appearance, much to the elation of fans. And so with belated breath, the film began to roll. A countdown appeared on screen, and then black fades into bright white. The audience loudly cheers and claps. The screen remains white. The audience's excitement calms down, anxious with what could be coming. Several minutes pass, nothing changes. Some members of the audience begin to express discontent. ""What's going on? Is there a problem?"" Luckily with the director in the room watching along, he could soothe their fears. ""Do not worry my friends, this is all a part of the experience!"" And so with reassurance by the film's creator, the audience settled down and focused their attention on the screen in anticipation. Several more minutes passed. People were starting to get uncomfortable. Nothing was playing, and the projector had been making strange noises within a few minutes of this white screen. Just when people were getting ready to leave, they saw movement. A small black speck on the white screen began to move erratically. There was confusion and hushed whispers. What's happening? Is this a part of the movie? They all watched with rapt attention as this small fleck bounced around, leaving and coming back from all angles. Finally an irate spectator yelled out: ""Oi, this ain't even the movie! That's just a goddamn fly buzzing around the screen!"" Clearly the projector had stopped working and the film wasn't playing. The crowd began to leave but in an attempt to save face, the director stood up once more. ""Friends please, do not leave, that fly isn't real, it's a part of the film!"" Angry with having wasted so much time and energy on this botched premiere, someone shouted out ""What on earth are you talking about? This was a failed release! Besides, why would that fly be a part of the film?"" In reply, the director answered: ""Because dear friends, at Best Edna Studios, that is not just a bug, it is a feature!""",0.0000370586,0.0087119201

He was very upset because he had worked so hard for his riches that he wanted to be able to take them with him... to Heaven. So he began to pray. God heard his plea and spoke to him. ""Sorry My Son, but you can't take your wealth with you."" ""Please God, I have worked so long, and so hard, for so many years. I have lost my wife, my kids, my dog, my health, and my happiness because of it... It is all I have left."" God understood and said. ""If it means that much to you, I will allow you one suitcase."" Overjoyed, the man gathered his largest suitcase and filled it to the brim with pure gold bars. He then placed it beside his bed and died in peace. Soon afterward the man showed up at the Pearly Gates of Heaven and was greeted by St.Peter. St. Peter was happy to see the man but was puzzled by the suitcase. The Man said, ""I realize this is not your normal policy but I was given the authority by God that I may bring one suitcase with me."" ""I see."" said St. Peter. ""Let us open it then."" St. Peter opened the suitcase, curious to see what worldly goods the man found too precious to leave behind and exclaimed,""YOU BROUGHT PAVEMENT?!!!"" ",0.0000970414,0.0001673568

14448,0,Four friends walk into a forest...,"This is my favourite and go-to joke and further elaborations and movements fitting those of the fourth person add to the joke: Four friends walk into a forest and close to the path they walk on they see a fairy trapped beneath a fallen tree. They decide to help her out and once they have lifted the tree the fairy thanks all of them and says: ""I will grant all four of you 3 wishes but you need to make those after a time span of 3 years each."" The first one answers: ""I would like to have 1000$ in cash right now!"" The fairy says: ""No problem!"" and hands the first guy his thousand dollars. The second guy continues to make his wish: ""My ford fiesta is a nice car but I would really like to drive an Audi A6"" ""Your wish shall become truth and the Audi is already parked in your garage at home."", says the fairy. Guy Nr. 3 is now at the row to make his wish: ""My flat isn't really that big and I definitely need more space if I want to start a family, so I would like to own a nice single-family house in the suburbs with a nice little garden."" ""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The keys to your new house and its address are inside of your letterbox back at your flat."" The last of the friends now asks the fairy: ""You know what would be really cool? If my head was spinning around in circles."" ""No problem"", says the fairy and the last guys head starts to spin around in circles. Three years later the four friends meet up again to see the fairy and make their second wishes. Once arrived the first guy makes his wish: ""The thousand dollars you gave me were really nice but after only 3 weeks I had already spent them so this time I wish for a million dollars in my bank account!"" ""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The money you wish for is now in your bank account."" The second one now makes his turn: ""The Audi you gave me handles really well and it's also pretty fast but I would really enjoy a faster car. This time I wish for a Porsche!"" ""No problem"", says the fairy. ""Additionally to your Audi I now placed a Porsche in your garage."" The third guy proceeds: ""The house I wished for is quite beautiful but I would like to have a bit more room and luxury. I wish for a big mansion close to the sea!"" ""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The keys and location of your mansion are now placed in a letter sent to your current address."" The fourth guy, still spinning his head, now makes his wish: ""You know fairy, it's pretty awesome that my head is now spinning all the time but it would be really really cool if my left arm was also spinning around in circles!"" ""No problem"", says the fairy and the last guys left arm now begins to spin. Three years later the four friends meet up one last time to see the fairy and make their final wishes. Once arrived the first guy makes his wish: ""Being a millionaire is a really nice thing but it would be quite awesome to be the richest guy in the world!"" ""No problem"", says the fairy, ""You are now the richest man in the world and all the money in the world summed up is now in your bank account."" The second one now makes his turn: ""The Porsche you gave me is really fast and way more fun to drive than the Audi but I wish to have the ability to get all sports cars and luxury cars I wish for!"" ""No problem"", says the fairy. ""I expanded your garage and whenever you wish for a car it's already inside next to all the other sporty cars and you will be able to drive a different sports car every day of the year."" The third guy now proceeds: ""I really enjoy living in that big mansion by the sea but the only thing that would be even better would be my very own island with an even bigger mansion on it."" ""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The boatsman on your private yacht will take you to your very own private island."" The fourth guy, still spinning his head and his left arm, now makes the final wish: ""You know fairy, it's pretty awesome that my head and my left arm are now spinning all the time but it would be really really cool if my right arm was also spinning around the whole time in the opposite direction as my left arm!"" ""No problem"", says the fairy and the last guys right arm now begins to spin. The four friends now meet each other in a bar after another three years has passed. And they start to talk about what has happened since the fairy granted them the wishes. The first guy starts talking about his life: ""My wealth is now big enough that there isn't a word to describe the number it has reached since I invested and multiplied it that often!"" ""That's pretty awesome"", says the second guy, ""I now drive the newest prototype cars since experiencing a different car every day gave me the ability to give the best of feedback to the car manufacturers while I even get paid for driving those multi-million dollar cars around."" The third guy now speaks about his very own wealth: ""I now own 50 additional islands and have built the most luxurious holiday resorts and earn a lot of money through that."" The last guy, still spinning his head and both arms around in circles now says: ""Guys, I think my wishes were bullshit.""",0.0000373759,0.0000733518

As he hastened over to help, he discovered that they were shivering uncontrollably in the brisk morning air. In desperation, they had moved up alongside some cows that were queued for milking, seeking some relief from the bovines' body warmth. At first, the cows didn't notice. But a few began to bustle about, annoyed by the intrusion. Carl the Cow took notice of the mounting tension, scrambling to take control of the situation before things got ugly.

14499,0,Professional gamer longs to impress girlfriend with his skills,"The gamer began by explaining that being THE BEST at any given video game is a tremendously difficult feat. While the disparity between the average gamer and the very best gamer is lost on the layperson, he assured her that the gap was incredibly vast. The average viewer lacks the capacity to perceive this difference in skill, and indeed, part of being so damn good at what you do is making it look easy and seamless. Honing your craft requires years of dedication, sacrifice, discipline, repetition, strategic ingenuity, clever thinking...in short, you practically have to live and breathe video games. The gamer explained how he had sacrificed multiple friendships in pursuit of this single-minded goal to be the best. He even personally designed practice routines and finger training exercises for whatever he struggled with on a particular day, whether it be reaction speed, accuracy of input sequences, precision of movement, etc. At night, he would dream of simulated scenarios that may occur in his games and appropriately respond to them, effectively practicing while sleeping. It was an all-consuming path and his brain was an engine that kept running. He claimed that he used to think he was great at video games because he was the best in his neighborhood, and then the best in his circle of friends, but that with the advent of the internet and online games, he quickly realized that his skills were far from the best. He began to study the play of the REAL best gamers who time and time again would prove their mettle on the world stage, bringing home championship after championship. He wasn't delusional enough to continue thinking he was the best, but he was convinced that with enough practice, that could be him one day. At this point the girl was rather impressed. ""That's so funny, I never thought of it that way, but I guess you're right. It's just like being good at anything else really. It takes a lot of practice, smart thinking, fast fingers... I've watched a little League of Legends and I think it was called... CS Gold?"" ""CS GO"" he corrected her. ""Come on over to my house and I'll show you what it takes to be great."" So she followed him to his house, in part excited to see just how good her boyfriend was, but mostly just happy to support him for something he was passionate about. They arrived at his room. He turned on his Xbox. The girl laughed hysterically and left, never to be heard from again. The girl's name? pcmasterrace",0.0006914825,0.0005091526

14545,0,"A spy, an artist, and a basketball player are chewing the fat on the beach","It was a lovely day so the three friends got together to enjoy each other's company and engage in stimulating discussions about various topics. The spy was initially hesitant to rendezvous at the beach, as she preferred more secluded settings where she had a chance to blend in with the crowd. On the beach, this was not possible, as she possessed an unrivaled figure that would be sure to attract attention from horny onlookers. But the spy recognized the futility of her efforts to persuade her stubborn friends so she ultimately decided to dress as modestly as possible in hopes of deflecting unwelcome eyes. It didn't work. She was the only person within a five-mile radius who came overdressed for the occasion. The artist noticed that there were a group of teenagers playing volleyball nearby and went over to ask them if he could join. The basketball player was puzzled by his friend's initiative, as everyone considered the artist something of a recluse. Perhaps the sun worked in mysterious ways and inspired in the artist what little social sensibility he could muster. The spy didn't think much of the gesture and turned her attention to the basketball player. ""Why don't you go join them?"" She asked. ""After all, you're a professional athlete."" ""You know why"" responded the basketball player. ""I most certainly do not"" replied the spy. ""In that case, I'm not going to tell you."" The day was growing old and the three friends said their goodbyes before retreating to their abodes. The spy reclined on her love seat and had a glass of wine while putting on her favorite record. The artist sat in his attic and painted a scene inspired by the day's events on the beach. He would take intermittent breaks to meditate and reflect. By the time he was finished with his painting, it was so marvelous and captured the authentic feeling of his experience on the beach so accurately that it was almost too beautiful to bear. He was impressed by his ability to directly translate his complicated emotions to the canvas and vowed to never grow complacent or satisfied with his progress for fear of resigning himself to idleness. Across town, the basketball player reached her home. That's the joke, the basketball player is a woman. You don't have to like it.",0.0028149623,0.0006988535

His fuel starts running a bit low so he pulls into an old gas station. An older fellow wearing faded jeans and a blue shirt with the gas station logo comes over to the side of the car. ""What'll it be?"" he says, hooking his fingers into his suspenders. ""Premium, and fill 'er up,"" says the young man. The gas station attendant, himself a petrol-head, admires the car and as he begins filling up the tank, he says ""This sure does look fast, but I'll bet ole Bessie's faster."" He jerks a thumb toward a bright blue Charger. ""I'll tell you what,"" he continues, ""I'll let you have this tank of gas on the house if you can beat me to the county line."" The kid mulls the offer over a bit. ""A race? What if I lose?"" ""You pay double the cost of the tank of gas. And tell you what, I'll even give you a head start. Soon as I finish pumping, you take off. First one to the county line wins, if you get there first, just keep going."" ""OK!"" The kid was excited at the prospect of not only getting to put his car through its paces, but getting a freebie out of the bargain as well. The old fellow drew the nozzle out, replaced the gas cap and slapped the fuel cover closed. The kid floored it out of the gas station. At first he didn't see anything behind him because of the dust. But as the dust cleared, he saw this tiny blue dot way back in the distance in his rear view mirror. The tiny dot began growing and growing and rapidly blurred past him. It was unbeliveably quick. He squinted and looked forward and could see way off ahead of him a tiny blue dot. It began growing and growing and again blurred past him at amazing speed until it was a tiny dot in the rearview mirror again. Once more the blue blur overtook him, but the kid realized he was approaching the county line and began to hit the brakes. Incredibly as he came to a stop at the county line, he saw the older fellow from the gas station laying in the middle of the road just ahead. He was covered in dirt and cuts and bruises. The kid was stunned. The old guy had beat him. ""That was amazing! But what happened to you? Where's your car?"" The old fellow stared up in horror at the kid, ""Car nothing!

14590,0,A farmer finds one of his pigs dead in his pasture.,"Without haste, the farmer phones the police and animal control requesting for assistance with the removal of the massive giant and dispose of it humanely. After 10 minutes had passed, a police cruiser with two constables and an animal control van with two animal control officers arrive on the scene and begin their duties. The two animal control officers quickly get to work with lifting the behemoth swine into their van, while the two constables interview the farmer on what happened. The farmer tells his story, giving every single detail of what happened and claims that the death of his pig was due to the pesticides he may have used for dusting his crops, but suggests the officers that they should investigate further as the farmer tells them that strangers have been coming onto his property at the late hours of the evening trying to sneak away with a new crop the farmer had recently planted. The constables agree and confer with the AC officers to give them details upon their findings as they perform an autopsy at their control centre. A few days pass and the constables receive news from animal control via phone call and tell them they are sending the dissected pig to their morgue for further examination. Ten minutes later, the same two AC officers arrive with the pig in the van and are led by the constables to the morgue with two large Tupperware containers in hand. They arrive in the morgue and begin to pull out the carcass, piece by piece onto the gurney in front of them. Then one of the AC officers pulls out three plastic bags full of greenery covered in mucus. One of the constables askes what they are and the AC officers says it's marijuana. The constables rush the bags of assumed marijuana to the laboratory for further examination and the results were the greenery in the bags were indeed marijuana. Relieved that their findings were true, one of the constables phones the farmer to give the news. The farmer answers the phone and the constable tells him of his findings. ""Sir, we have some news on your late pig,"" the constable starts, ""after our findings from animal control, we have found that your swine ate a plentiful amount of greenery which caused the sudden death of it."" ""And? Was it resulted from some pesticide I had used?"" The farmer questioned very curiously. ""Fortunately, no,"" the constable begins, ""your pig ingested a heavy amount of marijuana which in turn caused your pig to overdose."" The farmer relieved by the constable's news, made light of the situation, saying, ""Well, I guess I finally figured out what breed of pigs I'm raising."" ""And what breed would that be, sir?"" The constable asks. The farmer let out a hearty chuckle before he replied, ""Pot-bellied pigs."" ",0.0007000223,0.0001081951

It was called ""Tentacles With Everything"".","So I went in and asked for a table for one, and the waiter came over after a while and said ""Would sir prefer squid or octopus?"" and I said ""What?"" and he said ""Perhaps sir is new here... we specialize in squid and octopus, nothing else. Is this perhaps a new culinary experience for sir?"" Now I've eaten both *polpo* and *calamari* in posher joints than this, so I wasn't about to let this guy lord it over me, and I said ""Not at all. Is there a special of the day?"" and he said ""Not really, but we do have some very good squid in at the moment,"" so I said, ""All right, squid it is then."" And then we got down to the details. ""Farmed squid or wild?"" -- well, there was only one choice here, so I asked for wild, obviously. ""Green squid or purple?"" -- I asked the waiter for his recommendation, and he suggested green, so that was fine by me. ""Smooth lipped or hairy?"" -- well, that threw me, but he assured me that you don't actually eat the hairy bit, and if it was him then that's what he'd have been eating. Okay, hairy it was. So he took my order and said, ""Very well, sir, we'll just get you the squid of your choice out of the tank and Jervaise will cook it up for you."" In the meantime there were a few pretzels to munch on and I was fine with that. Ten minutes or so later the waiter came back with a martini, which I hadn't ordered, and he said ""I'm so sorry, sir, there is a bit of a hold-up here. Jervaise, I regret to say, is one of these temperamental sorts, and he says he will cook a dead squid to perfection, but he will not kill a live squid, and someone else must do it. Temperamental, I say, sir, but confidentially, I believe he is just too faint-hearted for the task. However, all is not lost. Our *plongeur*, Hans, is a very down-to-earth type and I am sure he will do the necessary when he starts his shift, and in the meantime would you care to accept this drink with the compliments of the management?"" Well, martini is not my usual tipple, but when someone else is paying I suppose it is worth a try, and I sat there sipping at the martini and toying idly with the bar snacks while I was waiting, and after a while I saw, without much surprise, that the waiter was coming back. He was full of apologies and assured me that there would be no charge for anything I had consumed, but, long story short, squid was off the menu tonight. Despite being supposedly down-to-earth and full of Teutonic bluntness, when Hans was handed the squid and the meat cleaver he proved completely unable to bear the trusting gaze of the unfortunate cephalopod, and the squid had been returned to the tank while the plate-washer went for a little sit-down and a quiet sob. And I summed up as I thought best: ""now, Hans that does dishes can be soft as Jervaise with wild green hairy-lipped squid.""",0.0000655055,0.0001371782

What could I do? I had no choice but to accept. I taught her everything: how to hold the bow, the correct way to pull the arrow, how to aim and everything. She was a quick learner. A few weeks in, she could hit the stationary targets surprisingly well, so I decided to step it up a notch earlier than expected: ""We're going to move on to moving targets. Now, the key thing to remember with moving targets is that as soon as you see the target in your aim, you have to shoot immediately. Don't contemplate, don't even think about it - as soon as you see it, you shoot!"" She was a natural! After just a couple of hours she could hit them just as well as - no, *better"" than the stationary targets! She was outstanding. I found myself starting to fall in love with her. The next week, I took her to the woods where to have her practice on wild animals as living targets. Just as expected, she picked it up almost instantly. It seemed like every single shot she took always hit her target. Honestly, at this point I think she ever surpassed my abilities! At this point, there was no doubt in my mind. I was madly in love with her! That night I asked her out on a date. She said to me: ""If you had asked me that when I first met you, I would say yes in a heartbeat! But after all this time, after all you've taught me... I can't see you as anything more, or anything less than my teacher. I'm sorry...

14815,0,Jay Leno Joke,"Two hunters are out and about in the bush when they suddenly approach a hole in the ground. The hole is pitch-black dark and they debate between themselves, how deep it might be? Quickly, one of them takes out a used bullet shell from his pocket and throws it into the hole. Nothing, they fail to hear it drop. The other hunter notices there's an anvil just by the hole and directs the other to help him lift and throw it into the hole. After considerable effort and at great expense of their backs, they manage to throw the anvil into the hole, but again are disappointed to not hear it hit the bottom. They stand over the hole, with their hands on their knees, squatting over to try and see if there's a bottom. Behind them there's a noise, some sound of trampling leaves and breaking branches in the bush. One hunter quickly grabs the other as a goat seemingly out of nowhere darts between them and straight into the hole. The hunters totally confused decide that it's time to get out of there and call it a day. As they head over to their truck parked on the side of a long narrow road there comes a farmer yelling Becky?? Becky?? and approaches the hunters to ask: ""hey have either of you seen a goat roaming around"". One of the hunters replies: ""Yes, in fact we saw it jump into this hole and points in the direction of the bush where they just came from"". The farmer replies: ""that's impossible, I had her tied an anvil"". \>>>>I heard this joke told by Jay Leno on a podcast deconstructing what makes for an effective joke<<<< &#x200B;",0.0000798459,0.0001672167

14840,0,"If it hadn't been for this man I met on Reddit, I would have been married a long time ago...","Backstory: Me and my BF of 5 years had what I thought was a great relationship and we were looking to settle down one day. But my life changed when I started chatting with this man on Reddit. I met him on r/jokes. This man complimented one of my jokes and we had a conversation which quickly turned into talking about each of our interests. We had a lot in common and I found out he lives in the same state I'm in.. I was always curious about meeting another redditor in real life and I thought it would be a good chance to make a new friend, so I decided ""why not?"" and decided to meet with him. We went out to a nearby burger king, and honestly, I didn't know meeting someone for lunch at a burger king could be so exciting. He introduced himself as ""Joe"" and I was blushing as he introduced himself. It was sooo embarrassing, but I decided to continue on and play it cool. Having lunch with Joe was relaxing. There was one moment where I got scared because he poked his eye trying to take a sip from his straw. I could tell he poked his eye real badly. Thankfully, he made a joke about it and we laughed it off. I was worried about his eye but he told me not to worry about it since he could just visit a doctor the next day. It made me feel relieved. Turns out, Joe was so funny and such a genuinely kind and interesting person. To top it off, he was very handsome. After we had our lunch, we said our goodbyes and honestly I've never felt such a strong connection before. I hate to say it, but I was attracted to him, VERY. And of course, I felt very guilty afterwards. So I told my BF what happened. He understood why I did it and told me not to talk to that man anymore, but from there, everything went into a downward spiral. It happened over the course of a few weeks.. We started arguing more, I kept on thinking about my lunch date with Joe, thinking about the ""what ifs"", and thinking that I needed to decide what I want with my life and what kind of person I wanted to spend it with. Me and my BF ended our relationship. It was sad, but we tried to end it on good terms as much as possible. After the breakup, I decided to contact the man I met on Reddit again, but he wouldn't answer me. I waited 2 weeks, still no answer. I couldn't find any of his profiles on Facebook, Instagram, or any social media. I wondered... ""did he give me a fake name?"" Was his name even Joe? I was pissed, but still eager to connect with him again. A couple of weeks later, I had an idea: ""how about I use Reddit.. to find this man...that I MET on Reddit?"" Why didn't I think of this before? I created multiple posts on different subreddits asking to see if this man named Joe is still lurking on Reddit, and I asked Joe to reach out to me if he saw my post. Then one day.. I finally got it. An orange notification. It was a reply from Joe's original account when we first met! Who knew of all places, Reddit would be where I reconnected with the love of my life again. I quickly opened up my post that was just a few days old, with the title ""Reddit you come from, Reddit you go? Reddit you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?"" &#x200B;",0.0001013999,0.0000643640

We had the war of the roses, now its time for the attack of the tomatoes! **Me:** I don't remember anything about tomato bushes. From one battle to the next. **Her:** Yep! Lookout tomatoes here comes the chutney recipe! **Me:** I can just imagine a cucumber campaign. Operation onion would be next, which will fail, causing everyone to cry. Dill Day follows, a great success for the allied gardeners. All too soon though, the kamikaze carrots set in, utterly ruining the radish raid. The mushroom maneuver is employed, saving the troops, allowing them to deal the final blow in the asparagus assault! **Her:** Don't forget the pumpkins want to supply ground cover with heavy support... **Me:** Ah yes, the pumpkin paratroopers. **Her:** Thyme is running out... **Me:** Prepare the beetroot bombs!!! **Her:** Aim for Potato Garden! **Me:** Fire the capsicum! Deploy the celery team! **Her:** Bring in the egg plant division to support the capsicum! **Me:** This is it boys, life or dirt! I want a passionfruit unit to find us a vantage point, and the strawberry unit to surround them! **Her:** We had better bring the lettuce up to date! **Me:** The cabbage are under withering fire, we need support from the raspberry division! The potatoes are mashed, so well need to send the zucchini in their place! **Her:** The zucchini can't take that heavy fire, they'll be grated. Send spinach for some extra iron. The sweet potatoes are digging in at the ridge. **Me:** Prepare the watermelon bomb, we need to finish this! The eggplant were squashed, deploy the broccoli brigade! The beans need to get out of there, or they'll be split! **Her:** Cauliflowers are going in to retrieve the beans. How brave to risk their florets! The corn commandos are deployed, but the artichokes are all out of heart, we need to boost morale. **Me:** The leeks are down! They'll be flattened if we don't do something! Are the spinach still operational? **Her:** Too bad the pepper isn't on our side, they're well seasoned troops. Spinach is a go! Nothing has touched it... **Me:** But wait! We still have the chillies to give them heavy fire! **Her:** And the squashes and peas! **Me:** The ginger is holding it's ground, but it's being cut down by the pineapple! The basil should make things interesting, send them to aid the potatoes. **Her:** The squashes might be able to pull a surprise attack if the peas act as a diversion.

""Who's there?"" replies Albert. ""It's me, Dave, let me in, we have to get going if we're going to catch our flight"" replies the unknown voice. Albert goes to the door and lets his friend Dave in.

As the two are driving to the airport, Dave suddenly shouts out, ""Look out!"" Albert swerves suddenly to avoid a small bird walking in front of their car. ""It's a chicken!"" exclaims Dave. ""Why did that chicken just cross the road?"" ""Looks like there's a farm over there"" says Albert. ""They must not have a fence set up, looks like the chickens just come and go as they please.""
